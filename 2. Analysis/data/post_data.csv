As I got older (starting in my late 20's) i also started to deal with anxiety.I've been to therapy... it just felt like I was always being validated, rather than gaining insight or ways to actually fight back. I was on an ssri- the lowest dose possible because I was terrified of things going sideways (occasionaly horror stories hit news media of these kind of drugs just amplifying problems). It sort of helped... but not much- and when I moved and needed to set up a new dr, my medication ran out before I could get an appointment. Coming off of that shit was HELL. So... risk/reward analysis... not doing that again.Anyway, I've had enough. I'm selling my house and will close down my 401k. With the money i get from that I can pay off all my debt and I figure if I can keep my monthly expenses fairly low i'll still have enough funds left to live another year or so- depending on how I handle lodging. I plan on doing whatever I want with that time. Driving the country... visiting with friends, family, and just trying to be happy- even if for a couple days at a time.As my funds draw down I plan on finding a beautiful and relatively secluded spot with a veiw that can be seen from my car -west coast summer sunsets are fucking amazing, so I'll probably wind up in like Southern California at the beach or something. I'll fast for a couple days beforehand and put a tarp down on my car seat so as not to leave a mess. I'll have cultivated a dope ass playlist by that time and will leave my Last will and testament on the dash. Then I'll hook up a dryer hose to the car exhaust and run it to the back window... recline the seat.. push play on the radio... and then take a little nap. Forever.I'm not religious... i'm not even sure i believe in anything like god or spirituality. But i'm still terrified of hell- even though living feels like i may as well already be there. I've done some pretty shitty things in my life and don't feel like i've balanced them out. Maybe I can't. Probably I can't. I think part of me is terrifed i'm just going to wake up at home like it's groundhog's day.",,

And even now, I sometimes have some really sad thoughts. Years ago, I ended up taking a few pills to end my life and ended up in the hospital. Long story, short, I survived and this put a lot of things into perspective for me.I'm very close to my mother and seeing the effect my actions had on her, really shook me. I know a lot of people might say that I should have seen that coming. But at that point I was so put down by my thoughts and feelings, I didn't really think about hers.I just want to say that your life isn't worth ending because right now you haven't experienced the many things that make you want to live and keep pushing. Think about people that make you happy, things you do for yourself that bring a smile. I know it's really hard but you have to force yourself out if it and make little changes. Hopefully, they'll soon become habits.Once you know what it is to love life and want to live it, it's a completely different experience.I know that life is difficult and this year has been particularly exhausting for everyone.I realize that this may not be everyone's case and that what all of us go through are very different, but if you need a few words of encouragement from someone who has been in the same spot and just need someone to tell you things that might help you, send me a message and I'll be more than happy to tell you about things that worked for me. Or if you'd like me to message to check in and see how you're doing- let me know that. If you don't have any of these thoughts, check in on someone you haven't for a while.I've been meaning to post this for a while and didn't and recently I've been talking to someone who needed a shoulder and I remembered how I felt and figured I'd post this in case it does help someone.You came so far and you're going to make it! Please don't be afraid about asking for help from people either. People can be unexpectedly kind. (:Sending lots of love and hugs, wherever you are.EDIT: I saw someone else posted something similar already, sorry didn't see that.

Im at my senior year of Hs but I don’t see my life getting any better then what it was 5 years ago. Ever since I was little I never had any friends, which made me socially awkward today since I never had that social interaction as a kid. I’ve been bullied, ridiculed of my weight and racially profiled, bean beaten bloody, was betrayed by my best friends after he told the school my secrets that I told him in confidence. To being rejected by my crush and then her telling the school she thought I was ugly. And now covid hit and I’m constantly fighting my mother of liver the dumbest things. Today I got into a fight with her about covid. Basically she wants to sell her old tv, so she posted it online and someone came INTO the house and looked at it. I got extremely pissed because not only are we in a lockdown, meaning if shit like his is caught by the cops she’s either getting arrested or fined thousands of dollars. But she got mad at me because I Apparently was being rude, which now I think about it I was. But I wasn’t mad at her I was mad at the world. My birthday is on the 21st, I’m turning 17. This was the very first birthday I was going to have that people actually wanted to go to. I finally had friend that wanted to come and spend time with me. This never happened to me all my life. I’ve had 3 birthdays were I’ve invited people to the house to celebrate and absolutely no one showed up, leaving me alone in the kitchen table with a cake and no one to celebrate with....... I just want someone to care...... I had to cancel all my birthday plans because of covid and now for some reason I brought it onto my mom. Now she yelled at me saying how rude I am and how she’s never paying for my phone again. Which kinda sucks but that’s not the point. I’m tired of getting yelled at. I’m trying to be better but my mind doesn’t let me. I constantly think of suicide and ways to kill myself and idk what to do anymore. All I bring is paint and disappointment to my mom and I don’t want to be here anymore......... I think I’m going to take my life",,

I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for alot longer than I would like to admit, my mental wellbeing and confidence kind of tanked at 16 due to high school and started being too stuck In my own head, thinking about what people thought of me and realizing that I was the person I thought I was. During  my time at uni I started to become my stressed and anxious about work and socializing, become very down and guilty about thinks but always had some hope that things could still change like becoming healthy and fit, finally get in to relationships etc (saying to my self I would get my shit together better) better day are coming, most people that care about me think the now I have finished my degree, my mental wellbeing should have improved and that my attempts to end  my life have gone but thought never left, in august j started experiencing pain and aches I  the joints and muscles especially round my knee and ankle and I started to feel those thought coming back but this time the thought of dying was scary but instead the thought of living does, who wants to be with someone who is broken; I’ve always had fears, anxiety and worries about certain aspects of myself and body (probably why have dating in very long time and am still a virgin when all my mate are getting partners and starting the think about families) , that little bit of hope I had is slowly disappearing, what is the point in living a life of pain, lonely angry hating myself more and more the days go by.

I come from a good family, I have friends, a girlfriend that somehow still loves me and is there for me. I’m back in school and my rent is cheap. This is the longest I’ve ever lived on my own. By all accounts, things should be good. But I’m deeply depressed, not always, but it comes in cycles, and for the past 7 months or so, I’ve been feeling depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. My coping skills suck. I used to cope by shooting heroin and coke into my veins. Smoking crack. Whatever, but mostly shooting dope. That lasted about 7 years. Then I went to prison for another 7 years, because of the drugs (armed robbery). I was happier in prison than I am out here. I mean, getting out felt amazing, I was so optimistic about everything. But eventually the old feelings came creeping back in, and it’s so hard to change my thinking. It’s like, I’ve debated over and over the pros and cons of life, the hopelessness of humanity, the fact we’re all gonna die alone, I feel like nobody understands me or listens to me, I’m terrified of death and not existing, and I’m terrified of eternal life as well, but just going to sleep and never waking up...there’s such an appeal to that. What stops me is my fear of death and what it would do to the people who care about me. I want to cut myself, like really slice my arms up good, but I resists the urges when they come. I want to go into the hood and inject every dirty rotten filthy drug they have into my veins, I just want to consume garbage, fuck prostitutes, strip naked, bend over, and spread myself open so the world can have their fucking way with me. Those are my coping skills. I’m a nice guy, a good person. I genuinely love helping people and I literally give my money away to homeless people and drug addicts. I feed my roommates. I clean up after them. I take care of people. And that’s fine, but after a certain point it just feels like these people are trying to take advantage of me. People are fucking selfish, myself included. People are fucked up. Not all of them, but enough of them to make me not want to be here anymore. I’m sick of dealing with everyone’s shit. I can’t sleep, I’m getting angry all the time, and I really just want to lay down and die, but I also don’t want to die because the thought fears me up so badly. So I’m basically just caught between a rock and a hard place. I can try to change my thinking all I want, but in the end, it won’t work because I already feel the way I feel. I can’t do drugs anymore, my parole officer wouldn’t like it, and my girlfriend and my family would probably fucking disown me. Like I said my PO would probably send me back to prison for that anyway, and I’m afraid of going back. Nothing too bad really happened to me in there, but after one year of being out, I’m beginning to see (and having pointed out to me) just how much that shit traumatized me. I’m a fucking wreck, a waste of talent, and a fucking degenerate. Things that bring me comfort: remembering lying on my bunk in prison to go to sleep and sleeping like a baby, the thought of injecting heroin into my arms, the thought of slicing myself up, the thought of getting off parole, and the thought of fucking dying. Ahhh, I can literally feel the tension lift away from my body just thinking about it.All that said - I’m not going to kill myself, I understand that my anxiety and depression are irrational, and I want to continue building a life for myself and a life with my girlfriend. This post started off as a comment on someone else’s post, and I decided to make my own post while I was at it. Stay strong my people, I am fucking here for you! I’m not just saying that. Send me a message if you want. And remember, the world is your fucking oyster.Things that help me/coping skills: cleaning, praying, meditating, yoga, working out, sometimes weed helps, I also stress eat, and play lots of video games to keep my mind distracted from reality.I know this probably all seems like some kind of psychotic, bipolar rant, and you’re absolutely right, that’s exactly what this is.",,

To sum it up: I didn't look after my teeth as a child due to a number of factors and as a result developed really bad teeth ie. five retained tooth roots, one fractured molar at the back and general fears of needing extensive work like fillings, root canals etc.Well! Things are looking up regarding that. I went to the dentist a week and a half ago for an appointment to essentially face my fear and also see about my front tooth (It had moved position and starting to make a popping sensation so I worried that it was loose - turned out be fine, just shifted a little). This dentist was... Amazing. I felt so happy with everything he did for me and he was really kind towards me. He did an exam, x rays and a general consultation and it turns out I'm going to be fine.Don't get me wrong, I definitely experienced some damage but nothing extreme like I was expecting. He told me mostly what I was expecting: I need my tooth roots removed, 3 fillings and to decide the fate of my fractured tooth (I'm having to choose between attempting to save it with a root canal and metal filling or just cut my losses and extract it - haven't decided yet). But... Nothing else! I couldn't believe it. No grafts. No invasive surgery. No gingivitis. No periodontitis.  I really thought I was basically going to be butchered.Now, I still obviously don't or won't have perfect teeth because I'll have removed teeth but I at least will have my teeth treated, get my work done and eventually have perfect teeth - which for me would be a full set of teeth without gaps and the basic function of chewing. That journey will likely entail braces and a partial denture but if it means I'll finally have normality (Or as close to it as possible).It might seem like a meagre joy but people take their teeth for granted. If you have a full set of teeth, I truly envy you. But I'm happy you never had to go through that ridicule and be victimised by the stigma of poor dental health. The work I need to be done, and perhaps the maintenance afterwards, is going to cost me an arm and a leg. But hey, that's the price you pay for your negligence. But it could've always been worse so I can still be thankful I suppose.I understand that this post doesn't exactly fit this sub but I just wanted to give maybe a bit of hope that perhaps things will get better. I won't try to police your emotions or try to tell you to be happy because that's something you'll have to find yourself. We all gathered here for the same purpose but different reasons. So I suppose my goal is just... Take the step you're afraid or unwilling to take. No, I don't mean that step - I mean the step to try to overcome whatever is troubling you.Whatever is hurting you or annoying you and pushing you to visit places like these, just wait it out. Or not, I'm can't control you. Just... Keep going, friend.Oh and DEFINITELY make that appointment. If there's anything troubling you healthwise, get it seen to NOW. Doesn't matter how trivial. Problems wait for no one.And, of course, brush your teeth and see your dentist!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!",,

Not deep enough because death wasn't the main intention. Seeing blood, feeling the pain, feeling the release of all the emotion and anger - that was the ultimate goal. Death would have been a happy side note.The scar hurts more than the cut did, which is irritating.My point of this post is to share with people who understand and won't run away, won't judge.I found a new coping skill. Instead of cutting, I paint... myself. With sharp angled, small brushes. With that fake vampire's blood stuff. It looks super fake when first applied. While it dries, it has an incredibly real resemblance to fresh blood. Same for dried blood when completely dried. It's somewhat therapeutic. If you happen to be very pale and fair skinned like I am, it leaves stains. Like temporary scars to remind what you painted - or write, like I do.If this app wasn't so dumb, I'd attach pics. They look so real. And I want to share, but I can't on fb because people freak out.I feel better after talking about it.",,

These couple of weeks coming back to school especially. I live in the UK. I'm a guy. Also have ADHD, Autism and I'm a bit like Crowley from Good Omens.I went back in September and over the lockdown and way before that I had a crush. On a gorgeous girl. Inside and Out. Told her first chance I got. Let's call her for the purposes of this Haze.Haze doesn't like me in that way because she just doesn't. Now at this point I wanted to move on. So I did with another girl. We went on a date of sorts. Put my arm around her and hugged her. I was so happy. We'll call her Ellie.After a couple days she broke it off. I was worried she'd told people. Couple weeks or days I can't remember she texted me saying she broke it off because she felt like she didn't know me and couldn't tell me anything. Felt so depressed.And after all that I started to fall for a guy. We'll call him James. He was someone I kinda knew but didn't at the same time. But in an art lesson I fell for him. Also looks a lot like 1970s Freddie Mercury. He is very bisexual. Couple days later someone in one of my classes got tested positive. Had to self isolate. Then I got ill with tonsillitis. For the 5th time. So I had to self isolate for my operation. Then stayed off to recover for a week. Then it was half term.When I finally came back I was going to tell James my feelings for him because I couldn't hide it anymore. The first Monday back was full of fear, gazing and felt like an entire week. At the end of the day when I found the chance I told him. Has a boyfriend. When I came home I started texting Haze telling her about everything that's happened. I went on call with her and one of her friends and barely said anything. She drew on herself with felt tip and had to stay off.The next couple of days were just me gazing longingly at James with sunglasses on and listening to Queen and The Sisters of Mercy. I see him almost all the time, feel nervous around him. I see Ellie a lot too she lives in the same town as I do, we get on the same bus. Not in any of classes but James is in a few. In art I'm now sat at the back and he's at the front.  I told the teacher about my problems rn not that I like James just that I asked a guy out and that I haven't had an easy life. Needed to get my bus so I rushed it slightly. This was Tuesday.Wednesday was the same. The rest of the week I talked to some of my friends and texted Haze. Friday a girl asked me out. Broke it off a day later. She has strict religious parents and they didn't want her to go out with anyone. Weekend was too short.Came back and I was trying ask James if he gave a shit by talking to people who I know that know him. Tuesday, Wednesday were kinda similar. He'd look back occasionally, feel shit. Out of the blue on Thursday, Haze was back in school said hi to me. Thursday was ok pretty much the same except for the end. At the end of the day the main person I was confiding in  about James told me I could do better.I don't know why but after that I became fucking furious. And felt like suicide. I followed James for a bit and was going to give me a piece of mind. I got to a point where him and some people he was walking with and I got cold feet and ran off. After that I called Haze I had a feeling she'd know what to do. I missed my bus because of my anger. I waited for Haze and told her everything. She understood.Me and her had a similar upbringing. Both dads let us down. Her dad tried to teach her that men were superior to women and her mum taught her better. My dad was similar. Never believed I had my condition and was an asshole.We talked about ourselves, my feelings, James and other things until my Grandad came down to pick me and take me home and I gave Haze a massive hug. And told Grandad what had happened today. Couldn't sleep next night but for some reason I was full of energy. Friday I got to wear my own clothes and was intent on apologising to James.Went to school and waited near the gates so I could try apologise to James. When I saw him he looked at me intently. The day was basically that. Me and him sharing eye contact. The past couple of days I'd talk to his friends and he'd occasionally come up and basically look right through me. I walked past him with Instant Crush by Daft Punk on and when I did walk past  him the lyric ""He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies."" played.Near the end of that Friday another one of the people who was helping me came up to me and asked me if I was okay. Said of course it wasn't and told him everything that happened and I told him to get James to talk to me. When I got out I went straight to my bus and then James came down to the bus stop not to get on, we live in different towns. But again we shared eye contact. And I swear Changes by David Bowie came on my spotify as I was locking eyes with him. Before I went home for some reason I heard Haze say at school that James was a bitch. Later that day I asked her what was wrong and she said that he'd pissed her off and didn't want to talk about it. A couple hours later I found James's snapchat and told him I'm sorry about everything.He forgave me. We kept texting and it was nice we said we'd be friends and that we would talk at school on Monday.We texted today in sorta spurts. This evening i asked him if he could help me with some hw said no because he didn't know if he could help. After I felt like drawing Crowley from Good Omens. About a couple minutes into my drawing I got texted by James telling me to accept a friend request I got on snapchat. At this point I was pretty happy and looking forward to seeing him/talking to him. At first I thought this person liked me. I had told James I wanted someone so I thought ""aw that's nice"" and accepted it.Turns out it was his boyfriend telling me to stay away from him. I told him that I can't choose who I like and I just did. Apologized. Then James texted me saying he was just making it clear. At this point I was pretty upset considering I just had a major hit to my confidence. So I felt quite alone. And I said that he turned me gay and I couldn't really just change it. In response he told me he can't just like me and that I was seemingly forcing him to like me. Annoyed I asked him if he gave a shit and sent him some messages about what I felt at that point.So I'm here. Idk if I want to kill myself or what. Please help.",,

I'm not good at anything in particular, I don't have any close friend, never had a girlfriend, I'm not particularly brilliant. I've always contemplate suicide but I've never tried it. Things now are getting to a point where they seems unbearable for me, I can't physically, emotionally and psychologically deal with this. Now, to the important part: in thinking about suicide, I stumbled upon what I consider the major issue. I'd ruin the lives of my parents, my brother, my relatives. Isn't this unfair? I have to keep going when clearly there are no reasons, only because some others egoistically will be sad otherwise. Obviously I care about them, and I don't want to doom their lives. It's strange because every feeling will cease, but at the same time what I feel now prevent me from feeling better (or nothing).

I have no hope for society, since I have realized the extent of my desires for equality amongst people are in the minority. Perhaps we will get better, but we will not even get close to a utopia.

I am such an average person in the sense that I have such a good life compared to others, so many things and people to be thankful for and yet I still feel the heavy emptiness that is constantly present.My family and friends and partner are all incredible and do so much for me and have given me so much, they will never admit it but they are far too good for me and always have been. It is getting harder and harder to go out and be with my loved ones, they could be spending their time doing so many other, more worthwhile things. It genuinely hurts not to scream at them, tear into them about how they could all be doing so much better without me, that they all deserve someone so much better than me.About 20 minutes ago I had a mental breakdown trying to come to terms with the reality before me, that I never have and never will be worth anything to anyone, they have all this faith in me and I know that I am never gonna pay it back to them. I am a pathetic socially awkward nobody with no future and the most painful lack of intelligence of anyone I have ever known, with that being my reality I might as well stop living it.I have attempted to hang myself a number of times and nearly jumped from roofs more times than I can count, and day by day, as I let myself and everyone else around me down more and more, it seems like the most selfless and beneficial choice I could make.I don't want to end this on a downer, but next time I post here might be to say goodbye, because I just don't ever see myself being any good to anyone.",,

I never really thought I would say anything in a place like this. Before this year I had never really struggled with depression, I had severe ADHD, but was a really happy person overall.

The relationship didn't last very long, and I really shouldn't have reacted the way I did, but the main thing I struggle with is the guilt I feel for the way I acted before and after the realationship. I worry that I'm the kind of person who does not deserve to be forgiven, that what I did was truly despicable. I don't really know what to do anymore, and I don't know how to know if I am a good or bad person. I understand it's not that simple, and that I should learn to move on and learn from my mistakes but I just can't. Some days I feel fine, especially parts of some days I feel like I used to. But at the same time there are so many parts of the day where I just look somewhere and start planning how I would end my life, whether I could actually do it, practically or feasibly. I ask my freinds if I'm a good person or not, and they sure yes, they know the other person involved, but I can never bring myself to tell the whole story of what happened, or when I have I can't really bring myself to do it in a unbiased way. I wish she would just tell everyone exactly what went down, just so people would judge me truly, but she say's that it's really only between us.

Would probably take a week to die, organs failing as it’s known to be toxic to your heart, brain, liver and kidneys. Would probably constantly hallucinate, and the hallucinations on that drug are horrific. Probably the least peaceful drug to overdose and die from.I wonder if DXM would be easier. I’ve had points where my breathing became so hard to do, I had to manually breath and it was very slow, maybe I’d black out and just stop breathing? Or maybe not, I’d probably have a psychotic episode, dissos do that. But there was points during a trip where I thought I was dying, or had died. It’s weirdly peaceful. Like, you just accept it. It’s quiet, a dark and peaceful void.But maybe it would be worth it to wait until I find heroin, and go out painlessly.

Incoming book of woe is me, tldr at the bottom.I'm 30 now and have had surgeries for tumors, gone to bankruptcy because of it and lost my 795 credit score, have depression, a mentally/verbally abusive family, am a divorcee, broke my ankle and couldn't go to the doctor because no health insurance so it's healed bad and anything that has me put weight on it hurts; essentially slowing down my exercise progress.I can't keep a job because my poor health, despite spending tons of money on medicine and healthcare supplements, so I'm poor as shit. My own family has called me a burden and useless. I'm not religious and I don't think it's hard to see why. My depression started officially when I was 15, but I like to think it really started when I was 4 and male family members and friends started sexually molesting me. Yes I did report people as soon as I understood what was happening, my family chose to believe I imagine it all. Then there was the actual rapes, full blown. Multiple times, you read that right. Left me with a fun ""for life"" medical souvenir, if you get my drift.My genetics are shit, because my parents literally drank cancer back in the old country (carcinogens in the form of pesticides, no one understood they should manage the runoff and divert it away from drinking water) so I'm losing my teeth, endocrine system, hair, skin, and my ovaries are caked in painful cysts. The doctors are talking more surgery, this time to remove my thyroid and gallbladder. I just had my uterus removed a couple months back because I grew a tumor so big it outgrew my womb. I'm fat, possibly prediabetic, and no amount of self care ever lessened my weight or improved my health. And I hit the gym for a minimum of 4 hours a week. The doctors insist that losing weight will help me, but refuse to acknowledge nothing is working and say I'm just lazy because all fat people get this way from being slobs.I looked at myself in the mirror today and just couldn't stop crying. I've kept my brave face all this time, telling myself it'll get better and then I can move out. If I just hold on and move out my mental health will improve. Maybe then it will all change, just maybe my health will move up and I can earn money.I could ask why me. I paid taxes, graduated high school, did all the counseling and medical mumbo jumbo like a good girl, even went and was careful never to have kids because I just didn't feel I was capable of keeping anyone else alive. Tried college, but I always got too sick to continue attending. I tried, with all my might, and stopped asking why. It's just hatred now.I don't think I have any strength anymore. I'm in quarantine because I'm positive for covid and all this time, I just haven't been able to make myself care about anything anymore. Regarding my fight to be strong, that is. Eating, sleeping, bathing, feeding my plants and my pet, working on ideas to make money, planning a possible future and the fun adventures it may bring me, I just can't.I can't remember what happiness feels like. I've long since stopped the antidepressants as years back, they tried all the ones available and none worked and I ran out of health insurance. I'd held on by sheer willpower since then but I think I'm out.I'm angry. I hate the world, my family, humanity as a whole, this body, the poison in everything we eat and breathe, how helpless I feel even though I did EVERYTHING I was supposed to to look after my health. Is this what it means to be on a sinking ship?A frenemy just told me to get back to meditating and eating right. Why? It just pissed me off that it's so easy to say this shit to people when it's not you suffering. Everyone tells me I need to heal but how the hell do you when life keeps digging the knife in deeper each time you stop the bleeding?I can't stop the anger. I keep rearing back from killing myself not because I'm afraid but because I've tried it 4 times now and I keep surviving: yet no one has ever found me or my notes. Funny, I even fail at killing myself.I like the idea of it ending. No more of this, you know? I'm not afraid. I feel guilty for being so casual about it when I know my mom has already lost her parents and her firstborn to violent deaths. But that makes me more mad. Why the hell should I care about ""who will miss me"" when none of them made my life any easier when I needed the help. Even my so-called best friend wouldn't let me move in with her because she likes her privacy, despite knowing I'm in an abusive home.TL;DR: I'm made of hate, but the body can't utilize it for self improvement anymore. How do I pull back? Is it even worth it at this point?Edit: My pet is being fed, my brother is doing it instead of me. Yes, I do feel like a shitbag.",,

I wanted to peel my skin suit off and burn it. My ball was huge and would NOT lay off the button.Here's an image that I keep with me. Imagine you are like a box. On one wall of your box is a button. A red pain button. Emotional pain. The worst.Every trauma, every painful word, every disappointment creates a form of grief or sadness (or even sadness thats pretending to be anger!) Pumps air into a super tough balloon ball thats just rolling around, bouncing around in that box. Randomly hitting the button. The bigger the grief ball gets, the more often it hits the pain button.The point where you want to die is usually when that ball is so damn big it just LAYS on that fuckin button.But if you picture it like this, you'll know, too...that eventually that air WILL escape. You can even help a LITTLE by envisioning a little air escaping with every exhalation.Over time, that ball gets a little smaller and a little smaller...sometimes some asshole or circumstance will throw some more air in there...but the ball never goes away. Eventually you could be left with a dot. Just bouncing around and it may hit that pain button...but happens far less often. The trade off is that it happens randomly so you never know when to expect it.For people with chronic depression, we need a little help, like from meds. I feel like the meds don't make the ball smaller. They don't make the box bigger....but they make the pain button just a bit harder to push, for some people.Anyway. That's how I try to make it through. It doesn't always work. Then I post here and actually include some of the poison thats in me so that maybe it isn't deadly anymore for me.Feel better, friends,  Please.",,

I've got a job, I've got a car, I've got people who care about me and I'm pretty well travelled so I should be happy, right?

So, I'll throw my 2 cents in since I'm in the same boat.My story starts in early high school. Natural progression and growth native to every societies' youth are the milestones I move to and from during those years. Typical, expected, just uniquely mine in an original way because of my choices. Unfortunately, I made some choices that ended up being mistakes. I made choices that were risky and didn't pay off how I would've liked. Most people would consider these types of things failures or consequences. Depending on your worldview, emotional maturity. intellect, and wisdom you might consider failure a good thing, a bad thing, or a combination of both. To me, all my failures have been dreams that suffered brutal deaths.Every sinking feeling I've experienced hasn't been a drop from positive emotions to negative ones or immediate sadness or loss of hope. No, those are write off explanations. That sinking weight was really just another anchor hooking into my soul and dragging me a little deeper into hell. Only recently have I realized this as I feel like I've jumped off a seaside cliff and I'm now deep in the water after impact. Yet, like being under the waves, there is a certain calmness to realizing my reality.Imagine your dream partner declining your most heartfelt exclamation (and offer) of love towards them. Imagine that happening multiple times. How many times could you keep trying?Imagine your dream career slipping through your fingers after fighting through shit job after shit job and the debt/demanding schedule of an accelerated college program. Can you work any job knowing the rest of your life you fell short? Do you care to do anything more than pay endless debt your whole life?Imagine having the ability to learn nearly anything just enough to be interested in pursuing that subject further only to lose all momentum and face nearly insurmountable resistance from internal and external sources that prohibit any meaningful progress. How many things could you pursue before you couldn't take being denied anymore?Imagine loved ones around you that support you in almost every endeavor. Now imagine a religious doctrine that guides all moral, ethical, and to some degree financial decisions and all wisdom from certain parties flows from that doctrine. Now imagine hypocritical well-wishing and encouragement to ""chase your dreams"" or ""only do what you love"". Hypocritical? How, you may ask? Imagine those same parties with that well-wishing following up to demand you about face and immediately do what is ""necessary"" so that you can ""move on"" with your life.Dream big but, only when you're within socially acceptable norms and expectancy. Also, you're not dreaming if you wander outside of those bounds because dreams and success only take monetary, financial, and superficial forms. How much hypocrisy could you take before you doubt even the greatest of intentions?How many times could you come to the same conclusion before you'd realize there's little you can do to change anything?How much would you have to lack before you realize you won't ever be enough?How can you claim to have your own life if you only live it for others?How do you have hope when all windows of opportunity have been missed?I have answers to all these questions, and I'm surprisingly calm about it. I'm holding on to life for right now. Every time I've come close to ending it all I've stopped. For one, I have a close loved one that has suffered from suicide in the past. So, to put them through it again is an agonizing thought.For two, there are many close friends and loved ones that rely much on my life. I'm an inspiration, a motivation, a light, a joy, an influence. I hate that I am those things sometimes. If I wasn't I most likely would've killed myself many times over by now.For three, I think I hold onto life because of what I've been taught. I was taught to fight, and to fight for others. Life is valuable, almost invaluable. It's worth every suffering, so they say. The ole, ""Why have a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" saying seems to sum up the darkness for most occasions. Yet, what do you do when your world is all darkness?I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since early high school. I was 13, and I imagined that if for some reason I hit an extreme low rather than high by my 25th year I'd commit suicide. Well, I'm 25 now, and I almost feel like this is inevitable. All my dreams are dead at the moment. I have little to live for in my own pursuit. I live merely for others at this moment and even those reasons are dwindling more each day. I have honestly tried very hard at many things. None of them really took off the way I imagined them. Some things I did really well with/at but their impact seems to have little sway over how I think nowadays.I'm empty. I don't care anymore. I'm not the type to go down a flaming wreck by throwing everything to the wind either. I'll go quietly, with many apologies left behind to aid the grieving.So, there's my 2. Maybe this post was helpful and in a relatable way. We all hit rock bottom. I guess we're all asking the same question too.What makes life worth living?",,

Or more so that I just want to self harm. The last time I cut I was 18. It's been 4 years since then and I would feel so shitty to do it again but for the past month I've been having the urge to do so.Me and my partner got into a fight and I seriously don't want to get into what triggered it. The image is burned in my skull right now and I just want to rip my own brain out. To make a long story short and skipping the triggering event; he said that I really angered him two days ago but didn't bring it up to me till now. I said something very insensitive without thinking and hurt his feelings which caused him to feel like he wants to distance himself from me. He said it made him feel unattracted to me.I feel absolutely horrible for what I said and for how it made him feel. And it doesn't help that since moving here I've felt nothing but ire and judgement from his mother. Luckily I'm getting my own place on Saturday (tomorrow) so at least that will be dealt with.After he went to bed, telling me it's not all my fault and that he's also sorry I still feel angry with myself, as well as insecure, ugly and undesirable. I already have extremely low self esteem and at this point I may as well be a literal pile of mud.I tried to cut myself but I didn't have any clean razors, only an old switch blade which I attempted to use. (Un)fortunately it's too dull to cut with so I am left with my thoughts on full blast and unable to sleep at 5:30am. There is SO much more that is causing me to feel the need to self harm but this particular event is what prompted it this night and the reason I'm just rambling away...I don't really want to die, but it's that feeling of wanting the suffering to end, if that makes sense. Just wanting absolute peace. I don't want to see anything, don't want to do anything, don't want to hear anything. I wish I could turn my senses off.

I've had suicidal thoughts for the last several years and have a pretty decent plan for when the time is right. My problem is, I feel forced to live, which has caused some resentment at times, and definitely feels like a curse. If I could die right now, and not even finish this message, I would!  But, my kids which I get every other week, would be crushed if I was that selfish. I so badly want to be selfish! I dont have any friends, not even acquaintances really.. just a loner, and this message is as close to me putting myself out there as I've been in years.  Im extra careful about my body language, especially around my kids, and do everything in my power to hide these feelings from them, so I have good awareness is what Im saying..  Anyway, a few years ago my daughter who's so intuitive,  comes to me, sad face, hugs me, and says ""dad, I couldn't live without you"", and then looks into my eyes and says she loves me.  I cant even begin to describe the feeling I felt..  just how... how could this little one know! Anyway, I saw a message on here which prompted me to write this today.. we all die eventually, why not wait until it's the right time.. I cried.. when will be my right time?  I'm only 39.. I have half my life to live yet, if I'm to die naturally that is.. sure my kids will grow up and may not need me everyday, which could be an opportunity... but I'll always remember those little eyes looking into my soul that day, so when is my right time?  No way I can do this for another 40 years, I'll end up in the hospital for sure...  I'm clearly depressed, and I get anxiety attacks, which, those in themselves make me want to just end this garbage filled life of mine.  And yes, my kids are not garbage, they are the most positive thing in my life, and their a big thing at that.. but as I said, I feel forced to live. I dont want to live!  I dont want help, I dont want relationships, I dont want anything.  My mind is cloudy, its getting harder each day for me to feel like I have any substance at all.  I actually feel like I'm getting stupider as I write this message, like my brain is slowly shutting down over time.  I've done research and have come to the conclusion that the root of my anxiety attacks stem from helplessness.  And that's just dumb!  Like I go into a full blown anxiety attack if my nose is runny and I feel like I cant stop it.  How screwed up am I.. I've always been super hard on myself, not sure why.  I know it started as a kid.  While others complain about being bullied by the big guy.. there's me.. bullying myself mentally, telling myself how worthless I really am!  The one person in my life that I decided to be vulnerable with, turned out to be gay and left me. So, needless to say, no one else will ever be in my inner circle again!  Sucks when you realize your living a lie for so long. I've gone through the stages of grief so many times already, that parts of me just feel numb. Yep, that's me, no problem feeling grief, but can't just be happy for the life of me..  Ah well, one day I'll just say F it who cares if my kids are sad... it'll only be for a few weeks, and they'll get over it, they're old enough..",,

I was 9 when I heard of suicide, and I was in an arguement on Skinseed about cats vs dogs I think, and the person I was arguing with threatened to commit suicide. I didn't know what that meant but I figured out from context clues that it means killing yourself. So they faked suicide and ""their friend took over their account"", which turned out to be the same person. But before they told me it was fake, i told them i would commit suicide too. And I seriously concidered it. I ended up not even trying because my little sister was just born.Now I'm 13. I'm suicidal again. I told people online that i was comitting suicide even though im not because im desperate for a reason to live.People just thought I was faking it, which i kind of was. I have to find new hobbies and stuff to keep myself from killing myself. Art is my main one, I'm also learning 3 languages and learning to play guitar. It's working, because now i want to master all of those skills before i die, and it distracts me from suicide.About the book, it's called Tears Of A Tiger and I really liked the book. Well, one day when i was looking it up to find the online copy of it (i dont have the physical book), I saw in the related searches one of them was ""how does Andy kill himself in tears of a tiger"". Andy is my name, so when I saw that he'd kill himself that definitely didnt help. Now as the book leads up to his suicide, i get scared. I had a dream about commiiting suicide, too. I didn't sleep long enough for my dream self to actually do it but i know if i slept any longer i would've, and at the end of the dream i was wanting to commit suicide.Also, i havent even been diagnosed with depression. Before you say im self-diagnosing, i dont go around saying i have depression. But I think I do because at the doctor's office i was given what looked like a test for depression, and i wouldve put high numbers on all of them but i didnt want my mom to worry about me or anything so i lied and put low numbers so the results would be i dont have depresin. But i could relate to all of the questions. I told my mom later when she found where i was saying id commit suicide online, and she said she'd try to get me to a therapist or something, but she hasn't done that yet.Anyways im in desperate need of help. :)",,

Nothing was said for a few seconds till I asked how her day was which made her crack a little smile which was cute. She let out a sigh and said not the way she thought it would go, in which I responded with yea I can see how that could be. She asked if i was ok but before i could respond i drove off. On my drive I planned on what to do now, which I had no idea what it was. I need up deciding that every year if I was at a low point I would do the same, and so I have.

As he smacked me across the face sending me to the ground he yelled, ""what the fuck ______ why did you scare of the deer I had it in my sights you little shit."" He grabbed me and threw me to me feet and told me to go fetch the arrows of which I had no way of finding.

 I struggle with severe depression and anxiety and I've been through therapy and medication and all that,  but both never really worked or made me close up more or feel worse. I feel that I truly could do better with patience and allowing things to get better but in reality i don't really want to exist at all, i would be better off if I had never been born even though I live a pretty decent life with a upper middle class family. But I just see the effort to be meaningless because I see every life choice to be just another stressor added on until your body can no longer function and die. Even living more freely or straightening up seems less amusing than anything.  There only reason I haven't just done it yet was because apparently I'd hurt everyone I know so I try to just keep it humane. 
It's hard to explain the feeling but I just don't see any point in trying to live when even the idea of trying just makes me less willing to live.

My parents are in their 60s, both retired and living off of meager savings. Both my younger brother and sister, both could have had their own families now, had the unfortunate task of being breadwinners for trying to provide for their elderly parents and their worthless pig of a eldest brother. We all live in one residence in the city and ever since my whole shit started, the ambience changed dramatically. No longer are there fond chats and talks about day to day activities, game nights, laughter, eating out. None of those anymore. Only silence, each minding their own business, only talking when needed. Quarantine just made it so much worse. I can see it in their eyes even if they don't speak. The disappointment, the regret, the fact that it is because of me that we're no longer a happy family.I feel the same hundredfold: disappointment, regret, failure, despair. Suicidal ideation is a permanent fixture of my everyday life for 3 years. Praying to whatever higher being or power to give me a stroke, aneurysm, heart attack, whatever, and kill me while, all the while feeling sorry for myself and crying myself to sleep, only to wake up the next morning, disappointed that I'm still alive for some reason. Therapy? Right. Because I need more reason to impose on them and bring us more into debt. Bullshit.I was always a good student. Top marks, got along well with both teachers and classmates, with a few close friends. People expected me to be successful at my chosen field. Had a job but quit on my second year because I was too weak and cowardly and didn't grit my teeth hard enough. Everything was a fluke apparently. Even people I know who repeated years in college have more successful lives than me. Depression hit me hard. Distanced myself from everyone. Blocked phone calls. No one succeeded in reaching out. Not that it mattered. Why push myself, a freaking wreck, into their lives anymore? Burdening my family is enough.For the past 3 years, I immersed myself in video games and youtube and filled my brain with trash. Tried to seek online companionships but to no avail. Sucks for me to believe that any meaningful relationships can happen online. Never. I feel like an infected foot. Something you cut off entirely so the rest of the body can live in harmony. I feel like I'm stuck. I can't go back to the workforce because I don't know anything anymore. All the things I've studied for are no more. What a waste of money I was. And I can't kill myself either because I don't wanna feel pain. I'm a coward through and through. In limbo. A very very very tiring limbo. If I try to think of what I'll be like 5 years from now, all I see is darkness. I hope I'll be dead by then. It would have been nice to kill myself now. Covid is an easy excuse that my family can tell other people for the reason of my disappearance. I don't need to be here. I have no purpose but to be a burden. Good thing I don't have children and I never planned to have any. Imagine the shit that those kids will go through. At least my pain ends with me when I'm dead. As for my family, so what? They'll grieve for a few months and get over it eventually. And they'll realize how happy they are now that I'm gone. I know because my mother actually told me in my face once that I am the reason they're not happy anymore. Told me to just go wherever I want to. Who knows. Maybe one of these days, I'll just leave and die on the streets and my body will be found in a ditch somewhere. Bonus points if I die of Covid. Can't wait to die. 2020 is already a crappy year anyway.P. S. Don't bother commenting. Empty words from random people I don't know.are worth shit.P. P. S. If you know a way to commit suicide without pain, pls DM me. I wanna try it.",,

I've exhausted all of my savings, and I've been living off $400 per week of unemployment, which isn't enough to keep up with expenses. I'm constantly overdrafted, and I always have to call my bank to schedule later date payments, because sometimes, unemployment checks come late. I'm going on 6 months without employment. I'm incredibly depressed, and without insurance or funds to seek any sort of mental health aide for my issues (C-PTSD, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders, depression), I told myself at the beginning of the month that I'd commit suicide if I didn't find a job by the end of the month. It is now mid-October.I was an idiot and truthfully told my employer during one-on-ones that while I'm open to working from home if the need arises (due to COVID-19), I'd prefer working onsite because my internet at home isn't the best (landlord has the cheapest package that always falters). I got fired the next day, during the start of the Stay At Home order at my state. Every job opportunity that has come my way either pulled out due to budgeting issues, or lowballed me to minimum wage and low hours, despite my 7 years of experience within my field.The only things that held me back from carrying out my plans were the fact that I couldn't find a bridge tall enough to jump from, and because of my boyfriend, whom I love very much. I've vented to him and he's willing to help me financially until I get back on my feet, but I'd honestly prefer to die than be a burden, because I   know he deserves better than a failure like myself, who's full of emotional baggage stemming from childhood trauma, as well as unemployment. Financial aide is nothing but a band-aid, and I am not a freeloader. From that experience, I've learned that the best way for me to carry it out is to no longer tell him about it, because I don't want to see him cry. He'll be sad for a while when I go away, but I know he'll move on with someone better deserving of him eventually. As for the bridges...well I remembered I can't swim. So, I plan to drown myself at a nearby lake. I'll probably tie some weights to my ankles, like bags of dirt or something of the sort, so that I can't come up.I get it, this pandemic creates unusual circumstances for job seekers. A lot of people say it's a temporary problem. My suicidal tendencies have been with me since age 17, when I started remember all of the trauma  that my mind repressed since age 4.  My family told me I was crazy, that my whole purpose of being adopted was so that I can be a human ATM for them, that I should think more about them, and that it's what I get for becoming an atheist. They also gaslighted me and told my adoptive parents a completely different story; my adoptive parents think I'm also crazy. Therapy and medication helped me extend my life by 10 years, but not without any hiccups. If I die, I'll no longer be a burden to my boyfriend, my family won't have to worry any crazy atheists in their family line, and best of all, I won't have to deal with constant mental health issues anymore that I can't do anything about due to lack of funds.",,

My parents were young when I was born and that meant I was always going to be a parent to my siblings I've had to grow up way to quickly. My parents divorced when I was about 3 and neither of my parents were too good at being alone so they moved on very quickly, almost immediately. My father had moved out of state and my mother began dating an ex soldier with PTSD who was extremely abusive and got her into drugs and they had my sister. When I was 5 my father took custody of my brother and I and we went to go stay with his new family which was a very toxic household, I had a new step brother and I got to see my half sister again (its complicated but my step mom was with my dad first so my half sister is older) I met my step mother who I very much love now but she was extremely abusive and she would find any and every reason to physically abuse my brother and I, I slept on the floor (all my siblings had beds) we rarely had the utilities on and I rarely ate and on top of it we never saw my father he was always either at work or off having affairs and I would often times stay up all night just to see if I could hear his voice before I would fall asleep but most times he didnt show. When I was 8 years old my  brother and I went to go visit my mom for summer break and mom died of a drug overdose squeezing me as she took her last breaths, My baby brother had to find her dead body in the morning because I couldn't move and I was afraid to scream, quite honestly I felt kind of numb but not the kind of numb where I wasn't sad just the kind where I knew i couldn't show any emotions because I had a lot of responsibilities and didnt want to be seen as a victim or make my siblings sad so I suppressed them and to this day I always check my fiancee's pulse at least 6 or 7 times a night because I fear it'll happen again. To back track a little my 1st day of kindergarten I came home from school quite upset about how my teacher kept calling me a girl and my mom was confused about why that upset me I didn't know what being a transgender individual was at that point but I just knew that I was a guy and because my grandmother was extremely religious my mom told me that this was going to be a secret between her and I and I liked that it was a secret with us because it made me feel like we were closer so I didn't tell anybody but you can imagine how much I hated myself growing up and when she passed away it took me a really long time to tell anybody else because I felt like that was one of the only things I had left with her and honestly I felt like I should be ashamed of myself due to my grandmother's views which I was later forced into. Throughout childhood I would always find a way to provide for my siblings because even though my dad was working the money never really went towards taking care of us my step mom would spend it on things like laptops and getting her hair and nails done and for weeks at a time I would run away from home but always come back at night to check on my siblings and nobody ever looked for me.  My father and my stepmother split up when I was 12 and my father took us back to live in our childhood home where my mom had passed away and as crazy as it may sound I would always sit in the room where it happened because it made me feel safe,  But that meant we were back in a religious home because my grandmother was still there and she says the only reason she let us all live there including my father is for my brother and I's sake,  That was too much for me to handle so at the age of 13 I ran away for the last time and never went back home my fiancee who was my bestfriend at the time brought me to her house and I lived with them till my fiancee and I just got our first apartment together last year,  It wasn't easy living with her family but it was way better then living with mine her mother was dating an abusive dude who would lay his hands on me and my fiancee's sister and he would always put us all down luckily hes not in the picture anymore. Things  are so much better now than I could have ever imagined but I'm still messed up as you can assume by everything that has happened plus more that I didnt even mention, I'm afraid to leave my apartment I haven't left since a little after we moved here last May and I feel like a lot of it stems from not being able to start hormone treatment due to my insurance not wanting to help but everytime I go outside I feel like I cant breathe, I get really lighthead and nauseous and even start to pass out and due to my fear of leaving my apartment I can't really work so my fiancee's income is all we have and we are barely making rent. I want to get help but can't seem to find a therapist who will come to the apartment especially since covid and it's gonna sound silly but due to my insecurities of my voice I won't do phone sessions either and I feel extremely helpless. I haven't self harmed in 4 months but I think about suicide every day when I wake up and recently I've been making plans to kill myself like i used to when i was younger and I feel like this time I'm probably going through with it but I feel horrible for my fiancee and our cats. I dont know what to do and it's not like I can reach out to a friend or family member because I don't talk to my family for the most part only really my brother and I don't want to burden him and the only friend I had was a narcissist who I had to cut off earlier this year so even though I have my fiance I feel alone. I'm sorry for rambling I know this is all over the place but this was my last attempt at trying to make myself feel a little bit better. I hope everyone else is doing well.",,

I'm on drugs and I'm one front  away from being harassed by an angry drug dealer who just wants the money I owe them.

I don't know what to do if I decide to continue living. I don't have a girlfriend and it hurts because I don't have a sister or living mom and grandma. So I feel like I just won't meant to have the opposite sex's company. I feel left out because I can't grow a beard. Work proved to be too stressful and my co-workers hated me. For the last six months all I've did was eat and do drugs. I don't hang out with anyone when I do drugs because that's a rough crowd and I'm a snowflake. I've been robbed 3 time and raped 5 times all before the age of 18. I even had a guy break my wrist before. I feel like I'm not cut out for the world. I don't fit in anywhere. My neighbor got drunk last fall and passed out on a railroad track in our back yard ( I live in an apartment building with about 23 others) and he died. I been thinking about following suit lately. I don't know what to do guys and it be nice to start over. The only good thing is I live on my own. But lately that's been a curse as I've lost social skills. If you made it this far than thank you.

Growing up, i was always the shy kid, and i never wanted to stand out. I just wanted to be like everyone, normal. But when i reached 15, that's when things started to go downhill. I developed social anxiety disorder and depression, which i think is something everyone here can relate to on some level haha. I started to have alot of suicidal thoughts, but in actual fact i know that i was too scared to do it. Which was the worst part, wanting to die but still not being able to actually go through with it.Throughout the years, i sought help, psychologist, school counsellors, etc. And at some point of time, it did seem like maybe i was getting better. That maybe i could be normal again. But the sad truth is that i can never escape from myself, my mind. Because till this day, 5 years later, im still the same. If not worst off than ever. In the last few weeks, i've contemplated suicide more than i did when i was younger. The only difference is that this time, i think i might have the actual guts to do it.People will probably wonder why am i like this. They often say ""Just don't think too much! Stay positive! There's so much in life to look forward to!"" But at the end of the day, arent these all just words? What can words really do. What i want, and i think i can speak for some of us here, is that we want to see something actually happen. After all, action speaks louder than words. Im sick of forcing myself to say those words, to say ""Maybe tomorrow will be better."". The truth is, it wont. Im just stuck in this constant cycle of depression. I swear, i dont ever wish to be like this. I wouldnt wanna wish depression on anyone, because it's just so fucking horrible. Having to live when you don't want to.

They believe I ruined their entire life with these dark thoughts that I told them about and are ashamed of me. They do not want to have anything to do with me anymore.My boyfriend (now-ex) only laughed off when I told him about my issues, taking it as a joke. This is all because I told them in a nice matter. What should I do? Get to the point where I try to harm myself in front of them so they can see I really cannot go on like this? I don't want to be a show off or a drama lady as they call it. I already burnt my hands and broke my head (I told my people it was accidental) to force my mind to think of physical pain instead of the emotional one, and that is not helping either.So I give up. I just don't want to feel anything at all anymore. I just want to know that my family and friends will be okay without me. I just want all my pain to end. My birthday is approaching very soon, and I think it would be nice to celebrate it one last time with them, and then...off I go.It is very nice to know there are good people like you, still trying to help others in pain like me.

My mind finds pleasure whenever I get hurt (not on purpose) and feel like I deserve it because I am a terrible human being.I thought it was just a passing phase, but it is almost half a year and it is getting worse, because now I started having also suicidal thoughts (I don’t really want to kill myself, I just want all this pain and unhappiness to end) – sometimes I even wished I was never born to begin with.I believed that sharing these worries with my dear ones (boyfriend, family) will help me somehow, but so far to no avail, they now think I’m crazy and suggested to seek professional help. So I did.I went first the church (my parents’ suggestion) to confess and ask for God’s help and forgiveness. You see, I am a believer in a bigger power, but not to the point where I would regularly go to church or pray – So I thought, why not? Maybe the priest could ease my mind with his advices. I was wrong. He was appalled at my confessions (I had an unfortunate miscarriage, got in an unhealthy relationship, at one point was so desperate to talk to someone that I talked to a “fortune teller” although I don’t believe in these either). The priest thinks now that I go hand in hand with the devil as he has granted all my previous wishes, and now God is making me pay for this. This news is not helping me at all.I went to a shrink/psychiatrist. He believes there is nothing wrong with me (that I “am very rational and make the difference between good and bad”), and it’s just a “passing phase”. He suggested I do things that I like to take my mind off these thoughts, and it’s not helping as I tried it already!!I started taking Xanax too (no medical prescription), and I’m not feeling any difference either, my pain and dark thoughts are still there.It has nothing to do with my workplace or family, all is well there. I tried to give myself time and do the things I once enjoyed- I find no more happiness in them. I just feel the need to find comfort in something or somebody, but I cannot. I am very afraid that one day I will act upon my dark thoughts and do something I regret. I am afraid that one day soon I will try to kill myself because I am very impulsive. I am feeling completely lost.",,

Everyone I’ve talked to doesn’t believe more or invalidates me or just makes me feel worse, but honestly I deserve it for making everyone’s life so much harder with my shit.

Things that used to excite me just don't anymore. I'm only 24 years old. Actually exploring these thoughts makesme want to cry. Is it because its the truth, or is it something inside of me begging to stay? I'm tired. I've built a life and a family for myself in the last 5 years.But what if what I built isn't what I want? I have plenty of options, but I don't want to be around to feel the pain I might cause by leaving. I cycle through differentphases of my life over and over again. I don't move forward. I wonder if this feeling is normal and we just try to make ourselves feel otherwise. Theres so much out thereto learn and to do but all I want is to sleep. When I wake up will I still be the same person? Is this just a mood or a culmination of my time here? If i seek help willit get better or will I just keep forcing this feeling down for the rest of my life in an attempt to soothe the people around me. I'm afraid to tell my wife. I'mafraid she won't understand. Or worse she will understand but beg me to stay. I can't handle this pain. Existence is torment. What if I'm already dead and this ishell. It would make sense for some parts of hell to be good in order to keep the illusion going. I don't believe hell is a place but what if its just a feeling. Theonly person torturing you is yourself, for the rest of your life/existence. I'm just so tired. I'm also afraid. This life I built could come crashing down at any minutewith or without any outward actions from myself. I can almost see the pieces fitting together like building blocks. I don't know if I'm a structural piece or an outerblock. I don't want to be a structual piece but I think I am. I think I'm holding this together and it hurts. I feel like I'm buried in stress and obligation. To mywife, I'm obligated to be here and to love her and our child. To my job, I feel like I am the only one keeping the place afloat and if I leave hundreds of people willfeel it. I feel like the king on a chessboard. Everything moves around me but if I fall so does my side of the board. The weight is crushing me and noone seems to careWon't someone please take this burden from me. Help me. Everyday I scream for help but noone comes. I am alone. I bury myself in entertainment.

I’m literally nothing special. I’m 16. I’m ugly. I’m fat. I have no friends. No one has ever loved me romantically. I’ve never once been someone’s “best friend”. No one ever wants to or has wanted to see me. No one wants to talk to me. No one cares about me. I’ve accomplished nothing in my life. I’ve never been talented at anything, average at best. I’m weak of mind and body. No will power to get fit. No one would care if I died.If many of the people I know read this list they’d tell me parts of it weren’t true, some might even be as delusional as to tell me none of it is. I don’t know whether these people are lying to me or themselves.Im ugly, I am ugly in objectively almost every way, no one has ever once found me attractive. Now you can say attractiveness is subjective, I guess that’s true but no one exists who’d think I’m good lookingI’m fat, objectively in every way I’m fat, majority of the weight on my body is comprised of fat and I am on the high end of a BMI index.I have no friends, the most controversial on the list. So many people would say they’re my friend but it’s not true, none of them want to see me, want to talk to me, they just do it. I don’t know whether it’s out of pity or if they get some self fulfilment out of it or genuinely just have a different definition of friend. The best way to sum up this would be: if in a holiday of 12 weeks I didn’t message any of them none of them would message me.No one has ever loved me romantically, realistically there’re two people who could argue to have “loved” me. Neither are genuine. Obvious for many, many reasons.I’ve never once been someone’s best friend, I don’t even think a soul in the course of humanity could argue this point. No one would ever call me there best friend.No one ever wants to talk or see me, I feel I’ve explained this already but pretty much no one would ever come to me in a million years to meet up or talk.No one cares about me, maybe a tad dramatic, my family obviously care about me but they’re obliged too so pretty sure it doesn’t count. Some of the people I know may say they care about me but that’s only in there own subjective way. They don’t want me to be hurt or die, that’s not caring about me, that’s good human nature, I don’t want anyone I know to be hurt or die.I’ve never accomplished anything in my life, I’m in no way talented, no exaggeration to these which is really sad.Weak of mind and body, like I said I’m fat, not overweight, being overweight can be healthy it can be muscle, but I’m just fat, fat and weak. And if I has will power or psychological strength id be able to change this.No one would care if I died. Now, definitely an exaggeration. My family would be sad definitely but only because they HAVE to be, if you live with anyone for they’re whole life and they don’t do anything wrong to you obviously you’ll be sad when they die. Some of the people who know me might force themselves to be sad but within I’d say a calculated 9 months everyone would be past it, they’d be sad maybe out of guilt or just because they think they should be.",,

Suicidal, even to a slight degree, for 2.So, a year ago, as of October 30th, a friend of mine killed herself. It really rocked me and shook me. I was already pretty depressed and suicidal before then, but, when she did that... it just sent me into a whole other phase. Mostly of me punishing myself because I had seen all the obvious signs, acknowledged them to myself, and just... ignored it. It haunted and still haunts me so much that I started to plan for my death. Writing a will, making apology videos I was planning to send out to people, writing down something detailing exactly how I would do it... I kept beating myself up over and over for just ignoring it... I started to cut myself on a regular basis. Nothing major, just a couple 1 inch cuts... for a while. Eventually I started to scar myself... I cut into my arm such a long length, it looks like I have a red colored pencil taped to my arm. Anyways, I'm still trying to fight my suicidal thoughts but they're gaining ground each day. I do not expect to be alive in 4 months. So, yeah... Also, the friend I was talking about, her name was Amy and I miss her so much... To all of you reading this, I hope you still have hope. If you don't, search for it. I lost mine when I ignored the signs. Dont lose yours too.",,

I had everything ready my note and all I just I didn't know how to do it. I wanted it painless but at this point who cares right. I've been doing research and believe it or not trying to do this is a much harder task then what was expected. I care about you, I would never want you to hurt yourself so I'm not going to share what I found. I have nothing more to offer anymore. I couldn't give less of a shit what could happen later on at the end of the day when you think about it there isn't one thing I could do that would matter in the end. Honestly, what a joke my life is. Everything I do isn't worth what everyone else goes through. I got a job so I could buy stuff to make me happy but I don't care about the money I like the job. It's a job at McDonald's and I hate the costumers but the people there they treat me so kindly they say how good I'm doing my boss said I'm one of the top 3 people he's ever hired. The maintenance guy, who works in the back he   was fixing something in the front when my mom came by and he said that they should get a discount just for being related to me. I know it sounds self absorbed but I usually am put down. Having people notice that I'm trying means a lot it reminds me my existence has a meaning even  a small one. The only problem is I'm a minor. My family told me school first and I agree but I don't think they understand how much pressure I'm experiencing. I qualify to get college credits in high school I get a lot of extra work ontop of what I already have. I have bad depression, ADHD, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, my step mom who is apparently a doctor selfdiagnosed me with Autism in front of the entire family that was fun, I have a lot more mental problems but that's enough listing of why my life is so bad and aww poor me. Anyways they think it's just work keeping me from doing my work when it's honestly the ONLY thing that's keeping me from just ending it. I want to tell them about my ED and a few other things but I don't want to be sent to a mental hospital and miss work. Anyways, I'm trying to show you why I don't think its selfish of me to want to work. That's what everyone is telling me that I only think about me. Here's why my dad leaves for work at 3 a.m. okay, what about my step mom who basically sits on her ass all day? Oh, she just got surgery. And I know I sound rude but she's been manipulating and abusing me mentally for years. And that's not my words that's my other family members and my friends words ❤ anyways she said she needs a break for two whole months and she won't be able to drive but ... crap silly me, I forgot about her twin sister who drove her daughter to work...oh wait no that was her...oh okay maybe it was her sister who walked down to stairs to ask me and my sister who stole her ice pack but then remembered she had her lovely daughter put it in the freezer..no..that can't be she said she wouldn't be able to walk down the stairs for a few weeks..oh well maybe it was her sister who lied to my dad and then when he got mad she jumped out of her seat to yell at him and threaten him with divorce more than 3 times and said how she helps him buy everything even though.....that can't be because not even 20 minutes before that did she complain to me for not washing a fork and then proceeded to tell me how much my dad works and how it's not fair for him to have to do all the dishes...no that was definitely her.. hmm you know what's funny I remember when my mom who was a single mother who had a baby removed from her uterus and then not even 3 days later my dad asked her to take us Trick or Treating...but why is it that my step mom can't do dishes? It's not even a big deal she asked me it's just the way in which she did was so uncalled for. Sorry, I'm venting, trying to forget my thoughts. Anyways I'm screwed big time so I better go.",,

I am very far from being involved in drugs, I’m a virgin basically never involved in a proper relationship, and my family wasn’t abusive. At least not physically.I just believe that everyone in my life would be better off without me. I’m hypersensitive to criticism and I don’t see anything but flaws in myself. Every time I have a breakdown over something incredibly minor, I feel so pathetic. It’s been years since anyone around me has told me they love me. Forever since a meaningful hug. Forever since I can conjure up a hefty list of things to stay alive for. They used to be my fam, especially my little brother, who is now growing too fast, becoming mean to me. Being with my family feels suffocating and you’d think I’d feel better with my friends but it’s so much worse. They’re all perfect and happy. They’re all stable. I guess it’s just a fault in me.Overall, it’s been so many years since I’ve been happy. Truly happy. I really like the rain btw, and clutching onto that keeps me alive. I know it’s weird. Watching the rain is what keeps me going.Travelling the world, getting married, going sky diving finally, nothing seems worth it anymore.I checked my nearest Pharmacy/Drug Store, I’m planning on overdosing on sleeping pills, if I ever go through with it. I checked the catalogue. 12 bucks, that’s how much my death costs.As for now I need a couple more emotional episodes to finally go and buy the pills. I just hope my family gets past it once it happens.I needed to get some stuff out. Nice to know I’m not alone, thanks for reading this far🙏🏽",,

I'm so tired of existing and being forced to stay for other people. My ex raped me and I thought the only way to be happy was to stay with him and raise the babies with their dad. Obviously he was just abusive. Now there's 2 kids in the world who are stuck with a shit father teaching them toxic masculinity while their mother ran away in cowardice. My current relationship lied to me from the start to get me to run away and now I can never go back. All his false promises and now I hate myself even more than I did. No friends. No family. All I was ever good for was to be a victim. Use and abuse. I'll never be happy. Please someone just give me a fatal dose of heroin so I can fall into the warm unconscious and never wake up. Guns too expensive. Hanging would traumatize those whod have to deal with the aftermath. Slit wrists are more likely to cause permanent damage than be fatal. Can't gas myself with carbon monoxide without endangering others. I wish I could develop a fatal disease. Why cant I just die.,,

I also think its my fucking fault but i wish just someone believed me. I wish i could trust in someone. Before he groomed me i thought he was a very close friend that I appreciated, he had my mum's phone number because i dont have a good relstionship with food and sometimes i used to black out in public or get dizzy. But he used my mom's number to threathen me for months telling me ""If you dont stop using your cellphone after 3 am, I will call your mom and tell her all your private stuff and your self harm issues""  or things like that i dont want to go thru the whole story but you can read it in my first post, it just was sooo triggering that my groomer, a 20 year old, visited my dad and asked him if I was doing okay. And just that. That was so triggering that I self harmed again. How does a person that sexually harrased you can visit your family like nothing happened? Sometimes it makes me derealizate and think that nothing ever happened and its all in my head and no one is real. are you all real?¿?  I just feel like I'm trapped in my body and i just have to wait that i lose self control and do something that makes me end up in a mental hospital. Currently starving myself til I black out or something i just dont care about my life anymore, just feel like i am a waste of money and space for my parents and my mental health has just been worse and worse and they all have their own problems and stuff I think they are gonna divorce soon idk my brother also has been depressed and my parents dont even notice, i have more than a week skipping breakfast and they dont even notice. I just feel like no one actually cares. I feel used. I feel useless I feel stupid He took advantage of me. I'm just 15 I wanna die real bad Please i need ways to kms The only thing stopping me from attemping suicide again is my brother who suffers from depression and social anxiety diagnosed at 14. But no one cares about me? Sometimes i wish i just had a stupid diagnosis so people would believe that I am feeling horrible and wanting to die. My parents say its all in my head and that i need to pray so the devil dont get in my head??? I dont know how to say that i cant go to therapy because my parents say its all in my head and that i have to believe in jesus. Fuck it. We all going to hell anyways.Weeks ago I met a cute girl and she is into me and so am I but I'm afraid she will get dissapointed when she knows me better, she also has mental health issues and i just think that it wont work out because i ruin everything. Everywhere i go. I am a troublemaker. She wants to meey me in person but its too soon and even if it wasnt my anxiety wont let me and my parents wont let me too im afraid I will catch the corona and make my parents mad because if i catch the virus again, they cant go to their jobs and start yelling at themselves about moneyA Week ago my dad left my mom alone at the hospital. What makes me think they will care about my mental health? Dont lie. It doesnt get better I have been suicidal since 12 Planning on starving myself to death because I'm such a pussy and I dont have enough courage to slit my wrist vertically in my own house. I hate my parents i hate everyone sorry for wasting your time. I cant go out alone because I KNOW my parents know that i have been suicidal they found some pills thing from my last attempt but they didnt notice that I attempted and I told them that I had been taking those  meds carefully to feel better But if I have the chance to go out alone i will try to jump off a bridge or something i just want to die.

People accidentally touch my boobs but brag about it to the entire school. People tell all their friends stories of how they would do things to me because I have good boobs.

I think it's me I've never been happy and I probably never will be.

I'm always angry at myself and my situation. I want it all to stop. Just make it stop.",,

I'm 15 and was diagnosed with both anxiety and depression at 10/11 respectively. I don't remember a time where the way I felt wasn't terrible, of course I go through euphoric times, but they usually don't last for more than 2 weeks. Sometimes the pain would ease and I would have some months where I felt like I was healing, only to have the earth colapse under me.The only thing on my mind right now is death and hate. I wanna end myself, I want the pain I deserve for being so fucking pathetic and disgusting (I was called this on the internet today! Thanks reddit!). I want to cut my chest open and bleed out. I want someone to shoot me in the head and then crush my skull with their foot. Because I deserve it.
 By themselves, things are amazing. I've been making a considerable amount of money off my art for the first time and I'll be part of an art collab that will give me a lot of visibility. Except I don't have the energy to draw, hate everything I do and think people shouldn't be buying anything from me because I am a disgusting liar. And let's not even mention online school.  
The only person who actually talks to me is my mom, I am an extrovert, I just don't have friends that like to talk to me and actually answer when I text them. I am not loved by anybody, and if I do, I can't feel it, so does it even matter?

I have been asking this question for 4 years already while progressively realising that there is no reason, life is meaningless and painful, it is well known that life itself is unfair and designed to be as painful as possible and not only that if not that one has to find a purpose or reason to live it even though that most of the time that reason is unobtainable by any means and as time progresses it will become harder and more painful if possible at all to get to that point, society since always has shown that hapiness, and a good life are most often than not reserved for the wealthy or the people in position of power than statistically a small fraction will ever achieve, the economic growth in today´s society is tied down to a lot of factors that are already pre set for people as their are born since if you do not have the privilege of being born on a place where wealth is rampant you are condemned to be unable to increase the stability of one´s economic situation being tied down to low wage jobs with heavy working hours that won´t allow you to do the things that you like or feel good in any shape or form but ofcorse one can still live ignoring this causes of this but still there is no point, even if you have some time to yourself you are discouraged of using it for things you like if not you shall use it to work for your future studying things that at least in my case you are not capable of doing at it´s full potential since im a stupid moron with the enough intelectual capacity to try to play a chess game with an ant and still lose and by thus lose all that time and future time condeming you to as already mentioned a full life of pointless work you don´t like to try to survive amongst the minimum, and if that´s not enough one needs to dedicate those studies to a specific degree to get so you can focus on working for the rest of your life, but allas I don´t know what to put that time of study on, well regardless I most choose even if you don´t like it and get an enormus amount of debt that I will spend an average of 30 years paying drgging me further down, but allas that´s not all people will tell you no no you are intelligent all of those are godamn lies, haven´t you seen my stupidity? ofcorse you have but you won´t say it since that´s disrespectful and who would disrespect somebody after all?, but hey maybe you can be on the low bitter but still after all this torment if you where good you will go to rest with god who loves you they said, well that´s another blatant lie made by society to control the masses, there is no such god, once I die, once you die there will be nothingness the void but our minds are not capable of comprehending the concept of not existing since the only thing it has ever know has been existance itself and even if god did exisist I wouldn´t go to heaven, there are the 10 comanments to follow which ofcorse if we go to the most simple one which is you won´t lie, wellI have lied, I have lied as an example being the most extreme of my well being, I am not ok by society´s standars since I want to kill myself and I have denied it so I broke a comandment and by thus deserve eternal suffering for the rest of fucking eternity but that is just one of the 10 which ofcorse you only need to brake one to burn eternally hypotetically speaking, and that is the least heavy one, while I agree that you shall not kill is a good comandment as an example that only broken people will break there is the one I just mentioned of lying which everyone has broken at least once daily and that´s enough to burn eternally but hey you can go and repent yes but what if you lie and die 5 minutes later, you didn´t repent so you go to hell and burn forever!, well at and as well one psycologhically and societally needs to have friends, bonds and people which I was able to make when I was younger but I have demonstrated that i am incapable to form any new ones and ofcorse this will drift appart once i get to collage and I will be doomed to spend the rest of my life alone, it took me a couple of years to stop negating that suicide was not bad since i was constantly avoiding the topic assuring myself that i want to live and that life is worth it but I have come to a realisation, my body knew that I wanted to kill myself before i did, I began 4 years ago to begin having sucidal thoughts and urges and while i did avoid them ignore them for a couple of years while they grew in intencity I had to eventually open my eyes and realise that I have to kill myself, that the voices where saying the thruth my body knew it all along why did I ignore it? I am already subconscisuously analyisng of methods and ways to kill myself constantly like jump now the car is coming, or you got the knife close stab yourself or look there is a fork and a outlet come on kill youself, I am meant to do this, and while I do know what I have to do that still is not an easy task since society wants you to stay alive, I cannot go to a hospital and request for assisted sucide and even if that was possible it probably would not be doable by me since a 16 year old is not an adult yet, it is something really complex and hard to plan since the tiniest mistake can ruin it all, and the fact that I am not an adult yet makes it even harder so I still have a couple of more motnhs to plan things out, there simply is a lot to consider to make sure I manage to die and leave the least mental impact to the people that love me so it really is a tricky process, I cannot believe that you have read until this point and thanks I guess but you didn´t have to, have a nice day I just had to get this out of my chest",,

So, basically life during the pandemic has felt slow and awful. In the beginning I loved the idea of being home all day. (I was laid off from my job and it has been torture trying to even find something else) Anyway, the last two months or so have been absolutely awful. There has been this overwhelming fear of impending doom. I’m sure a lot of people are feeling that, but it consumes me everyday. So many times I wake up in the middle of the night, constantly searching for good news. Obsessing over transmission rates and positivity rates in my town, something that I never worried about before. I think the longer this goes on the more I fear it will never end. It’s ruining my relationship and my friendships and even my parents are agitated at my constant seeking of reassurance. I just need to know everything will be okay, even though logically nobody knows. When I’m left alone I’m obsessing over these intrusive thoughts of seeing the people I love most getting sick and succumbing to this virus. Most people I know are cautious and concerned, and living in Massachusetts we have been doing extremely well at trying to control the spread in comparison to some other states. Yet, my intense paranoia continues. Fearing the second wave, fearing that if I decide to let my guard down and see a friend I will get it and pass it on to my loved ones. My mother had a small outdoor birthday party for me just invited my grandmother, my brother, niece and two friends of mine. Everyone else was just the people in my household. Yet the fear of catching it at my own party scared me so much I wanted to escape the fear and enjoy a normal day for once. After all it was my birthday. Well, it went down hill so fast. I decided to try and find comfort in an edible. I have been smoking weed for many years and consider myself to be an experienced user of marijuana. Well, this time the edible didn’t provide the once familiar comfort it used to. What I experienced was something you hear happening after someone dropped too much acid. The high came on slow, but long story short by the end of the night when I was supposed to be blowing out my candles and smiling for pictures opening presents I had what I’m sure is some type of psychotic episode.  I became convinced it was my fault of what was happening in the world because I didn’t listen and decided to smoke weed. That it was my fault for the pandemic because I never listened. I was screaming in fear that I was dying and if I went in my room that I would die and the world would collapse and that some greater being was about to pull the plug on “the simulation”. I was consumed in this delusion for HOURS. I scared my friends and they left haven’t heard from them since. I’m pretty sure my boyfriend is secretly mad or disgusted deep down. I feel like a failure. I feel like it’s not just a result from the edible but that I’m slowly losing my mind. I feel like I’m deteriorating and that this is what my future holds. To become paranoid, delusional, and psychotic. I’m upset that I let this pandemic get to me like this. I wish I could be more balanced like my friends. I wish I wasn’t consumed by fear. I just want to live my life. I want to work and have a happy relationship with my boyfriend but I don’t think that it’s meant for me. I feel like I should just die before I have to see the world get any worse. I can’t take the paranoia and anxiety anymore and I think they’d all be better off without me. I don’t know where I’m going with this, but I’m so sad and scared I don’t know who I can talk to.",,

It got better when I met my now ex girlfriend last year. we've been together for 5 months, then we broke up, then got back together again, and were together for like 7 months, until August 18th of this year. It crushed me. Since that day everything got worse again. I feel like I lost my reason to stay alive. My day starts with waking up and immediately feeling sad. It goes on with me going outside to school or something and feeling sad. And ends with going to bed and feeling sad. It kinda seems to me like my brain just really hates me and wants to torture the hell out of me. I can barely sleep anymore. My night goes something like this: I go to bed, try to sleep and my brain responds with just throwing sad, suicidal or other stupid thoughts at me. All night. It's so exhausting and I'm at a point again where I dont really see a point in going on with this mess that I call my life. Each day is an actual challenge for me. I just don't get why I should keep my brain torturing me like that.Idk, sorry if this.. text seems random and all over the place, I'm pretty much just trying to write down what Im currently thinking, and my brain is a mess.",,

I think i want advice. I am twenty years old. Im a white woman from the states and ive been middle class my whole life. Ive never had anything traumatizing happen. I always consider myself as very privileged and lucky. My father was in the military, so we moved several times, including to overseas, a totaly of ten moves in all. I was homeschooled most of my life. My parents are loving and supportive, my siblings and i have good relationships, i have good relatives and ive had good friends. Few friends have lasted, i have three from highschool, since ive moved so much. Life has been good. One of my earliest memories of me when i was five. For some reason i couldnt explain five year old me found it fun to sweep. So i asked my mom if i could sweep the kitchen. She said yes, her friends were there and said ""aw i wish my kids were helpful"" and my mom said ""oh she just wants attention."" I didnt sweep. I remember sitting at my kitchen table and wondering why i was born. And that was it, till i was 9 and we had a short six months in one city, where i went a couple months without any friends and cried and asked God why i didnt have friends. I even asked if he even loved me. I literally got a friend maybe that same month and I moved on. I started going to school for the first time while living overseas, in an American school, so there was no language barrier. Things went so bad. I was always a sad kid, i always had bad self esteem, but i was also a kid who would forget and move on and play with my friends. The first year i made plenty of friends and was only mildy sad, probably because i had to experience homework for the time in my life. The next year was different. I hated everythung about myself and I was sad constantly. I still went out and had fun, but come maybe the end of the year, i started wishing i didnt exist. And this is it. I would wish i didnt exist so often i imagined jumping off of buildings. Id be playing with my friends, and id see a ledge nearby, and tell myself to just jump head first. One night i was in my room sobbing. I was going to kill myself. I wrote suicide notes to everyone i knew. I was so scared. I went to my parents. They saw me crying, i mean i was sobbing. They asked what was wrong and being 11 years old, and not knowing how to stsrt a conversation about suicide, i juat said , ""well, schools been really hard,"" They disnt let me finish. they told me i had nothing to cry about, thst it was past my bed time and they were w ar tchung tv. I went back to my room. And honestly this is embarrasing, i tried to suffucate myself with a pillow. Obviously didnt work. I ended up falling asleep and feeling even worse in the morning. The only reason im alive is because im too dumb to kill myself. But maybe i also never got help because my attempt wasnt strong enough. Next year, still sad and mad and self hating, i started cutting myself. Little cuts on my wrists and hands i told everyone was my cat. My parents never even asked. I went to them one night, again after crying to myself, and honestly convinced i was insane and that was ok because i didnt wanna live anymore. I went to my parents and told them i gave myself the cut on my hand. They yelled at me. They told me they couldnt trust me anymore alone. They threatened not to let me go to the party my school was having the next day. I lied and said it was o ly that one. We hugged and they told me they loved me and i said it back. We moved to the states and i was homeschooled again and for the first time we werent around other kids. I went two years without friends. Things got weird. I believe i developed ocd, because my mother had it growing up and i would have compulsions and obsessions. It really was torture. I asked my mom for therapy. She yelled at me. I asked again. She told me that if someone could afford therapy, they didnt deserve to go. Things got weird. I developed anxiety so bad i got chest pains, nd my parents took me in to get an ekg. It came back good and they moved on. Id have panic attacks. I got weird and would try to soend all my time alone in my room. Then, i started hearing voices. It wasnt even really voices. Id hear people call my name. Constantly. Soemtimes just say ""come here,"" and theyd go from my full name to any of my nicknames. It was constant. I didn't sleep well. I started cutting myself again. We moved back overseas and i went to school. I stoll felt depressed. Id cut myself occasionally. Id have weird impulsive thoughts but for the most part id say i fought again my obsessions and won, for the most part. I was still suicidal. I developed an eating disorder, but it was never bad enough to get noticed, i didnt really lose any weight just bounched back and forth between ten pounds. I moved after two years and was homeschooled, though I kept a very inactive social life. It was enough. My eating disorder slowly left, mostly. I was still suicidal. We moved I graduated and i joined the Army. Now i am feeling better. Ive got friends, im moving forward in my career, my bosses like me. Even the asshole boss. My coworkers are friendly to me, and i have an amazing girlfriend. I would say its a couple times a month. I feel suicidal. Ill get tired and want to be alone. But if im alone im scared and sad. But im doing better. I just occasionally when im alone cry. A couple months ago i cut myself abit. I dont know why. I say its because i was overwhelmed, too much an introvert for how often im around people, but i dont know. Im just tired. I want to keep living. I want to grow old with my girlfriend. I just wish i had never been born.Am I fucked up, for a reason, that I can deal with and move on from or am I just fucked up from birth?",,

This is going to be a long one, I don't really expect anyone to read this... But if you do, in advance I would like to apologise, my English is self taught so I might have some mistakes here and there.I am a 20 year old girl from somewhere in this cruel world. I won't say that my life is the worst because I am sure people have it worst, its just that exactly because people have it worst I should be happy with what I have, but it just impossible for me.I would like to say that I born cursed, I can't exactly remember the last time that I was happy, the last time that I didn't feel this emptiness, when I didn't hate myself and when I didn't want to die.When I was 6 years old is the first memory that I have about trying to kill myself, my family had been fighting and I just went to the kitchen, took a knife and I was going to cut my wrist. I don't know where did I get that idea from, my sister was there so she stopped me and after that she and my mom explained why it was wrong and I should never do that, bla bla bla.When I was 8, men would look at me with desire, would say things at me and boys from my school used to touch me whenever they wanted. I developed an eating desorder since I thought that by getting fat they would stop harrasing me. They didn't stop and also the bullying started. They would call me ugly and then would touch me.I had to lose weight, and I did, I used to eat just twice or once a day, most of the time just a granola bar. The bullying didn't stop but as I grew older I started to fight back. One day when I was 13, two boys surrounded me and touched my however they wanted. My ex best friend was there, she didn't help me, she laughed. A teacher found us, she let the boys go without a warning and threatened that if I engaged in that behaviour again she would call my family.After that I lost one of the most important people in my life. I got really depressed, and with all the memories of the abuse I started to have suicidal thoughts, I used to cut myself, starve myself and just wish I was dead and that person was alive.15 years old I got a trip to Europe as a gift. While in Europe, in beautiful places, I didn't stop thinking about how I should die. My aunt told me in that trip that people didn't love me because i was useful but because I had born. I wish I hadn't.17 I get this idea to apply for this schoolarship, I spend a year preparing, my resume was literally perfect... I didn't get the schoolarship.I spend the next months planing my death, I pack my stuff, I clean my room, I say my goodbyes, after I had the chance, someone else in my family died and my friends notice that someone is wrong and make an intervention.At 19 I start going to the therapist, things where okay for the first months, I learned how the sexual abuse had affected my life, how my family was really toxic and overall how scared I was of being happy and how hard it was for me to feel emotions. I have a poor emotional intelligence. I told my family I was going because of my anxiety, in reality it was my last chance on staying alive.The other day after the session when I finally speak about the sexual abuse and how scared I am of men, my sister's boyfriend threatened with killing us if she didn't gave him money, I spend the last couple of weeks without sleeping.20, I finally at the start of this year got my shit back together, I started going to university, I stop pushing my friends and I stated to forgive my family. Someone died, I spend the weeks scared because of the way they died we where in danger too. Things started to go downhill again.My mom and sister  are just constantly fighting, and in every fight my mom brings up how she wants to kill herself and my sister just answer that she want to kill herself too, at some points it just a fight about who wants to die more. Sometimes if they are fighting with other family members they just bring up the fact about how everyone else besides them both wanted that my mother aborted me. I wish I had.Or sometimes they would talk about that men that was with my mom when I was little, how he beated the shit out of her in front of me and they found her almost dead.Or how my sister's boyfriend once when I was little gave my so many spanks that they hat to take me to the doctors, and how they still together.Sometimes is the thought that my aunt used to watch porn, masturbate and have cyber sex with men in the same room as I was sleeping In. Sometimes is how she used to fight with me everyday and how I had to spend 4 years at her house because my mom didn't really knew how to take care of me. How maybe because she wanted that I was aborted she treated me so poorly when I was young, saying how bad I looked because I was fat and how no men would love me. And also the fact that now her house is the only safe place where I can go so I don't have to hear my sister and mom fighting about who want to die more.I meet a wonderful guy at the beginning of the year, he is too good looking and too sweet and  I know that if it wasn't for his autism (that makes him bad at being social) he wouldn't even be looking at me. I have nothing to offer and even though I am sure he loves me,  I know he deserves better. Someone pretty, someone that can give him what he needs. I really wanted to have a relationship with him, but we both agreed that this was not the moment for both of us, I know that he can find something better.My father was never present, I was a baby that he had out of marriage, the only way he shows me love is giving me money, he has told my multiple times that this is his way to show me love.I could go on and on... But I think that good enough for now, I feel much better after writing all this and even thought If no one is reading at least I got this out of my chest.If you read, I don't know if I am waiting for someone to give me advice, or kind words or just make fun of me...

Im there right now.I never find comfort in typing/speaking my issues bc it doesnt help me. But i gotta keep trying things.Over quarantine I accidentally fell down a flight of stairs and seriously messed up my spine, but the pain while lasting and painful wasnt as bad as i thought it could be. When ever I find myself at the bottom of the stairs i pause/sigh/take a minute because since i moved to this place over a year ago I find myself lacking the energy to just go up this stair case on a daily basis, ive had breakdowns at the bottom too.. so this staircase is always on my mind.Besides some pretty gruesome things i want to do like, hanging myself downstairs, poking knifes to see if i should try cutting my legs and arms, smashing my head repeatedly into a wall (banging/taping w/forehead is soothing), etc, I caught myself hanging over the staircase with my eyes close wanting to letting go so fucking bad. I started sliding my feet backwards and lifting my fingers but then i heard a door open so i stoped.This was the closest attempt ive had in months and it wasnt even at my lowest energy level.Ive been having all sorts of nightmares about seeing strangers get eaten slowly and then a beast started to eat me, getting stabbed, stress nightmares, and even me getting stabbed multiple times on an airplane.Basically ive been having visceral passive thoughts and nightmares after about 2 months of no thoughts and its just been fucking me up, waking up exhausted , wanting to die at 7am, and with leftover pain physically.——————————————————————I tend to be super resliant and just get too busy and over committed so I can distract myself from my depression, but ive been crumbling so much since late 2018. ive started getting professional health because after years I cant handle it on my own anymore and I just cant get shit done anymore.Everything just takes too much energy to do. My academic, career, and social life have been crumbling bc of it and I no longer know what im working towards and for an idealistic/future oriented this is fucking me up because i dont see a reason to continue.Im way too fucking stubborn to let myself go bc of the popular thoughts  “Oh you might do something amazing in the future” “its selfish, think about those left behind” “suicide is an end, there is nothing after, you cease to exist”Im not special, i may be one of a kind, but my thoughts and ideas are not, my issues are not, I don’t have a life purpose in mind, and im having an identity crisis trying to determine who I am outside of my sadness. “Beauty/joy/love/laughter only exist bc of pain/loss” I DONT WANT TO BE MY DEPRESSION I DONT WANT TO RELY ON IT FOR THE GOOD MOMENTS IN LIFE I DONT WANT TO TAP INTO MY PAIN. I WANT ALL THIS SHIT TO BE OVER.Chances are, no one read this, and thats fine.

No money coming in. Rent is passed due along with other bills. There’s no food, but the dog has food and that’s what I care about.

I’m writing down an idea I had from a previous picture I just looked at while watching this video. I start writing it down. There’s noise down below my Studio. I can’t find my pen. There’s movement up the steps, someone walking with a dog, I hear the sniffing. There a bark from the other side of the door. My dog barks and I call him over, he doesn’t come over. I call him over again and he comes over, but doesn’t stop barking. I call my dog up and he sits. He and I have a moment. I don’t look good, but I love my dog and I take this opportunity as a photo op with him. He’s showing a lot of attention to me for once. I decide to take a video and tell him how much I love him which turns into how much I failed him. Which turned into how much I failed my mother. That got me back to thinking a lot. Which leads me back to being penniless and jobless. Which led me to looking up easy ways to kill yourself, from where I passed the prevention hotline number and when straight to Wikipedia which I proceed to scroll down.

But Deep down, I feel unhappy. My main goal in life is to make those I love happy. I always say I'm fine. Even when I'm not. I want everyone to be happy. I dont want them to feel bad because I do. I want them to stop caring about me and do what they want to do. They always ask me, ""what do you want to do?"" I give them the same question. to no avail has the other surrendered to their own happiness. But sometimes, I don't feel happy even when they do. Sometimes I feel like they won't care if I leave. Well, I know one them will. My mom. She seems to be the one who cares the most. She pushes herself too hard to take care of me and my two brothers. My dad, because of his job, isn't always there. And when he is it feels like he does love me, but he seems to want me to do my best, even when I don't want to. He sees potential in me that frankly, I don't see myself. When my brother isn't verbally outwitting me, blindly following my misdeeds, or just hating me in general, he looks up to me, and I hate it. As I said previously, I hate it when people think I'm worthy of love, and I especially hate it when people think I'm good. But he likes me. When my younger brother isn't looking at a screen, he wants one. And when he doesn't get one, he acts four years younger than he is. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, and they love me, but sometimes I don't want them to. Sometimes I want them to do what they want without their love towards me holding them back. Sometimes I want to end it as a way of freeing them from the inconvenience of loving me. It makes me unsure of my emotion. The uncertainty tears me apart. This has been... Relieving. To pour out the emotions I trust no one with has really helped me.😊",,

I was done with life and I wanted out immediatelly. I found myself as a parasite, a leech to everyone's happiness. I felt like a monster, I hated every aspect of myself. I thought that I didn't bring any good to this world and that eliminating me would lift off the weight on my loved one's shoulders.On July 6th this year, I attempted. I downed some cough medicine and cold medicine but it wasn't enough for me. I keep getting fed heavypills by my parents if I ever fall sick from a simple cold. I think my body just grew accustomed to it. I wrote my suicide letters, gave it to a person I trust, and I slept my night away with an intense headache, fastened heartbeat, and I was literally suffocating away as everything started to black out. I felt serene when I couldnt see anymore and thought to myself I was dying. Then I woke up with two warm fingers on my cold neck. I felt like my stomach wasn't there, I couldn't feel my diaphragm, like it was hollow. Cold sweat and blurry vision accompanied my wake too. My parents were notified by the friend I sent my letters to. Amazingly he got a hold of them, he never even knew them, I survived that day.First thoughts I had were of dissapointment, on how I can't even kill myself properly. How devastated I was to reality. Then things started to shift. The first days were harsh, I kept feeling sick and uneasy, couldn't eat anything but porridge and water. Being force fed coconut milk was awesome too. But all in all, my vision was cleared. I see the light in the tunnel, not at the end of the tunnel, but around myself and just places that don't have to be the end. I can make my own spark now, and I'm positive everyone else can too.What Ive learnt: Once you get beaten down theres no way other than up. Reality isn't as grim as we think, well in the past it wasn't as grim as I thought. Really I got a reality check, these grim thoughts were all really just delusions that our brain decided to just pull up. Anxiety, overthinking, paranoia, fear, all of that. There are things that we can control, and things that we can't control. We can't make everyone think of us positively, its up to them to decide, and if you think what you are doing is good already, then it's all fine. Intentions matter. Things that are in the past will stay in the past. We must and should focus in the present where all our actions will determine our future and be inscribed into our memory. The future is something to hope for and something we can mold. We can't expect life to be wonderful to us always, there is always a balance in things. To live is to literally suffer, that is true, but to survive is to find meaning in that suffering.Philosophers/PhilosophiesI recommend reading and questioning your life to (but not to the point of meaningless)Stoicism (plenty of philosophers talk about this, watch Pewdiepie's video on it. While I wasn't introduced to it through him, it delves quite enough into it)Taoism (Buddhist monks)Friedrich Nietzche (Nihillism)You can do this. Believe in yourself.",,

I don't know why, other than I got close to one of them and the family didn't like it. But that's all I know. My mother has openly admitted that she never ""developed any attachments"" to me. People have been extremely abusive to me right in front of her and she just says it's my fault and I deserve it. Recently I had a serious allergic reaction and she told me I wasn't allowed at her house and cussed me out when I called my grandmother to take me to hospital instead. My mother told me ""she couldn't be bothered"". My grandmother has had several strokes that make her act like she's got Alzheimer's, and sometimes she's good and acts like the mother I wish I had, but the rest of the time she tries to kill me and is very abusive. I try to help with her though because my mother can't be bothered to do it, and I like her when she's lucid. I don't have any local friends, and my online friends barely talk to me. My local friends just treated me like a dirty secret, barely ever talked to me, and refused to ever include me in anything. I've tried everything I could think of, everything I could find, and everything that was ever suggested to try to improve my social skills so I could at least have a friend. Every time I try to develop a connection with someone they still just treat me like I'm an evil monster or something. No matter how nice I am, they just instantly hate me. I lost my job just before Thanksgiving, and starved thru the holidays. I finally got a new one about a month ago, but the guy somehow got it in his head that I had skills I specifically told him I didn't. After the first day he said I wasn't fast enough. I did my best to improve, and have improved significantly. He just tells me I'm still not fast enough and that I'm ""not worth the money or training"" that I'm not even ""worth paying"". I told him about my bf so he could open his other restaurant back up, and he said he liked the idea and could really use the money from the other location. But as soon as he met my bf he got even meaner towards me, constantly pulling me aside to tell me how worthless I am and that the govt is ""paying me too much"" and ""making him"" pay me too much. I make minimum wage. Once my bf started working for him officially, he gave him an average of 6-8hrs, starting at 5 days a week, and wanted to give him more. He cut my hours to 0. I got depressed because of it and my bf said it was mostly my fault because I decided to try to be nice and warn him that if he tried to replace me with my bf it would upset my bf and he'd end up losing us both. I also tried to come up with ideas to make my costs less while I was learning, and told him I just wanted things to work out for everyone. While my bf initially said it sounded good, he changed his mind later and started calling it blackmail and said I deserved to get fired and that he no longer had to quit and go back to his old job because now he had a reason to fire me. My social skills aren't great, I thought I was being helpful.... My bf who had moved in with me for the job, and who has been increasingly asshole-ish since he moved in started blaming me for him having to quit the ""job he loved"" (like we'd agreed in advance that he would if he was just used to replace me). I tried to give him space cuz he said my being affectionate and trying to cuddle was ""being too clingy"". So I slept on the floor, which really hurt because I have a dislocated rib. He woke up, said he didn't sleep because I wasn't there and as a result was in a lot of pain (joints? He has some nerve damage on his arm.). So he decided to quit, and just blamed me. I tried to come up with ways he could not lose the job and he just got mad at me and packed up his things and left. My bc has made me very suicidal this cycle, during all of this, but tbh I already was. I've been abused and hated my entire life. I've tried everything to find some group I could fit in with, I've tried everything to be nice and more likeable, but nothing has ever worked. And I'm just tired of fighting. I'm tired of trying. I don't know how much of it is the hormones, but... I'm tired. I've tried, and no one ever gives me a chance. I don't know why. There's clearly nothing I can offer this world, no one wants me, and no one cares what happens to me. I think the only person that would be effected is my grandmother, and she'll just forget after a while. My absence has never effected anyone. I don't see the permanence of my absence effecting them anymore than it already does. I'm just... Done.",,

By 10:39 this morning, I killed myself 13 times, in 13 different ways… in my head.  I don’t know what it was or what exactly led up to me breaking but I did.  As I laid on my bed, I had a euphoric feeling and felt like I was floating above myself watching.  My brain and my body were urging me to walk into the garage, get my 12 gauge and finish myself off.  I don’t know if it was my soul or my heart that was stopping me from doing it but it made my body physically hurt as I fought the urge to stand up and go….  I begged my son to lay with me and hold me.  I realized I was freaking him out so I let him go.  My dog at this point was stand with his front paws on my bed watching knowing that something was wrong.  He jumped up and immediately took my sons spot in my arms.  All of this helped but the urge was still pulling me.  I went through the normal steps of breathing and thinking about all the good things in my life, all the people that depended on me and loved me…  Even if I am often an asshole, but still the urge was pulling me and the pain was so intense I couldn’t help but scream and cry.  I know I was manifesting the pain but had no way to stop it.  Eventually I had to get out of my house and away from the thoughts of what was waiting for me in my garage.  As I drove, I was still floating but the pain went away.  I was still thinking about killing myself but the physical urge was gone.  I don’t remember driving…  I don’t remember turning…  I don’t remember parking, but before I knew it, I was in a Walmart parking lot.  I laid back in my seat and listened to “I feel like dying” by Lil Wayne 7 or 8 times.  I had gone to Walmart for a reason but couldn’t think of why so I just sat in my car and felt sorry for myself.  Eventually I got a message on my football team’s app asking about the game later today.  I immediately remember I needed ice and Gatorade for after the game.  As I walked through Walmart, I went out of my way to be nice and courteous to everyone who came near me…  Not trying to brag I did it for a selfish reason.  I needed someone to be nice or kind to me.  To my surprise, almost 100% of the people I interacted with were polite and talkative, almost like they could feel something wrong with me, or that I needed that from them.  I eventually made it back home where I am now pouring out my feelings.  My thoughts are clear and the urge is gone but the damage has been done.  My wife and kids are at the mall…  My wife who is afraid to go into 7-Eleven because of COVID would rather risk the mall than be around me right now and I get it.  I will be fine and I will do everything in my power to repair my relationship like I always do, but in the back of my mind I always wonder is this the last straw for her?  I hope not but understand if it is.  She knows my past and knows what I’ve been through but I know she can only take so much.  I will always love her and my kids and put them before anything else but I am scared I’m pushing them away.  I pretend like I have my mental issues in order because I take my medication daily and I go to the VA twice a year to tell them I’m fine, but that is all bullshit.  I’m not fine…  I wish I were strong enough to go sit down with someone and tell them everything I saw and everything that happened to me, but the thought of it scares the living shit out of me.  In the past 12 years I have had come to Jesus moments where I went through all the steps to set up regular counseling and each time I pussy out and don’t show.  The scary part of all of this is that the VA, knowing my issues and where my head was at, at that time, never reached out or called to see what’s up.  Each time I received a letter in the mail, weeks later, saying I missed an appointment and to “call this number to reschedule.”  I’m not trying to put them blame on them… In the end it’s my responsibility to be there but my fear is stopping me.  I served in the military from 2002 to 2008.  I have so many surgeries that I have lost count.  I wake up every day in pain.  I’m lucky if it’s just one of my problem areas, but I’m sure that doesn’t help my mental state.  I saw some fucked up shit and some terrible things happened to me.  As much as I push it all down and drink the thoughts away, they still creep into my dreams.  To the point where even though the nightmares only happen every couple of months, there is a reoccurring person in my dreams, from one of my memories, that started as a night terror and now she is living and interacting in my dreams like a normal person.  How fucked is that?  I have pushed it down so deep that I have normalized a dead person to where she now alive and interacting with me in my dreams.  I have never said that to anyone and reading it back makes me realize how crazy I might be lol.   If this gets out and you took the time to read it, I’m sorry for the rambling and the poor me shit…  I honestly have an amazing life that my wife and I have built.  We have three beautiful kids and three awesome dogs.  We live in a big house, in a quite suburb, and have everything we want or need.  All of that makes it that much harder for me to wrap my head around morning like today.  I say that I could never do anything like that to my wife and kids, but honestly how much more damage am I doing with constantly being an asshole to them.  Would they be better off with out me?  Not necessarily dead, but out of the picture.  Do I do more good than harm?  These are question I need to figure out for myself and take the appropriate actions to fix them.  Here come the cringy ending…  I am NOT OK and that is OK.  I need to start taking responsibility for my own mental health.  I’m tired of walking around and acting like I have my shit together and making everyone think I have the perfect life.  I doubt they think that but you understand what I’m saying.  ",,

My dad was a cop, my mom was a fucking cultist.  I'm an invasion era combat vet. Until Monday I had been a civil servant at one level of gov or another for 22 years then I got laid off. Where to begin? So my dad was one of the first SWAT cops ever, in Chicago in particular and the Midwest as a whole. He was alright I had a decent relationship with him till he passed, while I was invading Iraq.  Which was fucked up as cult bitch mom had been dieing in a bed for years and yet somehow out lived him, evil bitch.My early life sucked ass for years till my ma left to go do cultist things. My dad moved in with my grams, whom we both loved. He obviously worked fucked up ass hours but when he was off we did all kinds of cool shit. I think i was in 2nd grade when ma came back. I was fucking pissed even as a what, 8yo? I hated her so much for just thinking it was cool for her to just roll back in like it was normal. No one cared what I thought and that made me mistrust dad on a hardcore level, even at that age. I have guilt about that but, he did me wrong, hard wrong.Once ma moved back in she went after my relationship with Grams like a fucking demon. Hid me away,  made dad get his own place again, talked shit to my young ass about my rather fucking awesome and loving grams, to my face like I knew what she was talking about. FUCK! Then at like 9 or 10 years she left dad again  but took my ass with her this time. I WAS NOT COOL WITH THIS!I was beaten regularly with switches and other such southern fucking bullshit. I was sexually abused and punished for bull shit reasons by the rest of the community as it was known. I rarely saw my mother because I needed to be brought in line with the community again, as it was known. I don't remember or want to talk about much but I will share this, I was once fed napkins for a fucking day because I had a booger hanging from my nose and no one told me. STRAP THAT SHIT ON.I remember dudes I didn't know taking me and my bullshit ma to Charlotte NC Airport one day. They had suits and my dad and grams were there. I was so happy to see them, grams went the fuck off on ma in public, asking the suites dudes to arrest her but they didn't do shit to ma. I even yelled for them to lock that bitch up but, dad just picked me and carried me away. That was my second plane ride ever. Ma was in the back of that plane. FUCK.We got back to Indianus and I lived only with grams for years. Then I turned 12 and was sent back to my ""parents"" man, I was fucking devastated beyond explanation. Suddenly I couldn't play with toys anymore, I had chores all day, everyday and if I got a C in anything  in school I was beaten, terribly by my ma with my dads belts. This was my new life? I ran away repeatedly but could only run to grams, where she found me everytime, duh.Now I'm in my early teens, junior high, getting in fights and getting suspended constantly! Like three times a week I'd beat a mother because someone knew who I was and told thier kids I was mouth raped as a child. I didn't want to be a giant cuntbag but you can't just talk shit about that to my face, of course I beat your child's ass, I was no longer able to feel physical pain. I just reacted. The punishments for these transgressions were not only fucking weird but mentally destructive.The first semester was standard, dad would express his disappointment, fucking pussy ass. No longer a cop by the way.. Then shit just got out of this world. I once had my entire room taken away. I had to sleep in the guest room, after I helped dad take the fucking door off of the hinges. So there I was, just on fucking display for that terrible bitch. I was made to dust my actual room everyday while I was suspended so I would miss all that I had had before I got into more fights. Then, after that was all over guess what.... id5just have to go beat a mother fuckers ass again so, it was worse.Anyway, I can't keep on that topic for too long. It reminds me of how my dad failed me as a protector and a mentor. So I ran away at 16 and became a crust punk. Now hold up as I've never written a post this long and I want to see if it'll actually post...",,

Makes me more depressed, more kind of just looking for an excuse to opt out early instead of live in constant existential horror. Im not really sure what Im looking for here, or anywhere else. I don't have a calling, goals, any real amount of self respect, etc. I'm just exhausted. Physically, emotionally, and psychologically I'm at a breaking point. I've cut myself to the bone several times in the past couple months, and i can't shake the feeling that I'm living on borrowed time, or the suspicion that I'm warming up for something more serious and final. I've tried to talk to my wife about it, but the topic in general is so painful for her that it just ends up scaring the shit out of her without any resolution.

Why I am still in constant pain. Being drowned so badly  with emotions. Now it feels like I have no escape.I  know I managed to survived it before. But now it seems I am fully  trapped, like a rat to be eaten by a snake. Except, it is just staring  at me. With its watchful eyes, enjoying me suffer more and more.I  don't know what else to do. I am desperate for help. But I am left to  fend for myself. I have no more strength to give. I wish to live, but  not like this, not like this.My  heart feels like it is being torn apart from the inside. My life feels  meaning less. I know I must fight back, but each time I get up I get  destroyed. I am so helpless. My soul has suffered so much. This is what  hell feels like. I am living in hell. I don't feel happiness. Slowly, my  soul burns in the flames of doom. My life is doomed.I  don't what to experience this anymore. It hurts so bad. I can't do  anything to stop. Please Stop, Please Stop. No amount of alcohol could  end it. Its just there. The snake, its eyes just constantly glaring at  me.Just end it, just end it. How  hard is it? I can't live like this. I don't know where else to go. The  challenges are too great to deal with. Its too painful to endure. I have  suffered enough. When would it end?This  is hell, an invisible fire burning through my soul. Living in constant  fear and hopelessness. No cure can save me. Slowly, my soul vaporizes.  You'll never see happiness. Only suffering. Wherever you go, whatever  you do, you constantly in deep thoughts. Breathing becomes harder, your  anxiety level gets extreme. You'll be begging for it to stop but it  still there. Crucified  forever, except no salvation on the end. Just  hell. Each time I wake, my world feels heavy. I guess I am getting  closer to the end.Please make it stop...Some  people in this world cannot be saved. If you have someone special in  life, make sure you let them know how important they are. Appreciate the  simple moments being with that person. Because once they leave, you'll  miss something very important. While others like me will continue to  linger alone, until I meet my end. I hope its soon, I envy those who  have died, I wish I could follow too.",,

At 7 years old I was rushed to an er building up and sent to the room number 707. Where I waited and was talked to by 7 different people explaining to me and or probing me to find out why I thought this. At some point I was handed a bottle and told ""Here, this will make you better!"" The bottle was a medication my mother called ""happy little tic tacs."" The bottle was for 70mg of a medication that after 7 years of being on it found out kids werent supposed to be on it. This medication made me feel as though my eyes where a screen only viewing what was happening around me. As though I was nothing more than a passenger to everything around me. When I was on the 7 floor (and people wonder why I hate the number 7) or the roof top of a friends apartment building. I noticed the edge and how it looked to the ground. Wed play I spy and try to watch the things we would throw over hit the ground. It was while staring at the ground that I only recently found out to be called ""the call of the void"". As a kid it was terrifying but also hard to resist. I climbed the railing before my friends realized. After sitting on the railing for sometime watching in horror from a screen that all I could do was mentally scream at I somehow gained control. I threw myself in the opposite direction of the ever loving abyss. But once you've seen the abyss, you always see the abyss.And that is why I've been suicidal from 7.",,

This is not my first account I made this one for obvious reasons. I won’t bore you with my entire life story but I’ve felt the need to say this for a long time. Since about age 13 I’ve thought about hurting myself. A year later and I was in a deep depressed state and got the cops called on me due to a suicide attempt. Since then I took meds for a year then lied to my doctors saying I felt fine because I just felt like a robot, no emotions at all. Since then I’ve held on but those thoughts of ending my life have always come back. This year has been odd for everyone. I’ve been thinking of attempting to end my life seriously for the first time since my last attempt. Don’t even get my started on other people, though that’s not the reasoning of these thoughts. Honestly as silly as this may sound my body feels like it’s been failing me for awhile now. Again I’ll skip a lot of details but various areas of my body hurts and aches. I’m trying whatever I can to make it stop but I feel I’ve screwed it up to badly to fix. Just when it seems I fixed one issue a new one arises. And now I’m hurting so bad psychically and hospitals are already busy enough I doubt anything could help. I’m a ticking time bomb waiting for the day where something random will occur physically and it’ll kill me. Unless I end my suffering myself..I’ll keep waiting it out as best I can see if these issues eventually go away but I doubt they will..I know it might sound dumb but I just want all this mental and physical pain I feel to be over..Sorry for the long and sorta vague post including all details would make this to long imo.

When I get mad (real life events or instrusives thoughts) , I hurt myself (slaps, chokes and scratches) and sometimes I have thoughts about murdering suicide. I am scared of these ideas. I isolate myself. I can trust anyone even myself. In september,  I will study in university for the second year (my first one was a complet disaster). I will not repeat the same mistake. I decided to push my friends away because I am tired of being scared of what they would think of me. I look at the world and I see people having much worst than I. I feel invalid. Life is good in my opinion but I don't think I deserve to have one.I told myself this :The next year of study is the most important, I will have to prove to myself that I can be better. If I win this year, I will have more hope about me et my futur. If I fail this year, I will live long enough to see myself as an eternal failure in the eyes of everyone around me, there is a risk i can kill someone with this self hatred.

It feels odd because it feels like I shouldn’t be invited, even though I’m the bride. It feels like I’m going to be sitting in on a stranger’s experience because I wonder whether or not I’ll actually be at my wedding.I’m a mother. I have two children of my own and a step son by my fiancé (technically married for legal reasons, but we’re having our actual wedding next year). I love my children dearly, and right now I don’t have any plans to kill myself, but I am suicidal. I find myself wondering why I’m still here. I feel like the only reason I’m still here is because of my 3 year old and 7 month old. They love their mommy and I love them with all my heart, but I don’t want to live my life anymore.I don’t want to go into detail about why I want to end my life, but long story short, I feel like my whole life I’ve been striving for happiness, but instead I’m always met with abuse and tragedy and I’m empty. I feel so numb and empty and I have for such a long, long time. I feel like everything I try to do to make my life better blows up in my face. I’m not myself anymore. I spend all day fantasizing about the life I want, but can never have.Maybe I’m selfish. I know I’m selfish. I’m selfish because the thing I want put myself before everyone else in my life that I’m responsible for, but I think it’s because of a lack of prioritizing myself. There are people who need me here and I know that and that’s why I stay but the emptiness is getting louder and I’m scared it’ll take over.So I have to wonder if I’ll be here for my wedding in a few months. Or here to own my first home. Or to see my children start school or grow up or be here for puberty or the first heartbreak. I’m not my best self like this and I’m not the best mom or wife I can be like this. If I’m only going to get worse, why stay and make it hurt more?",,

We stopped doing it as frequently but here and there we would very little and I knew that he would still do so with his friends. A few time he would get angry at me for using without him and in December I had a holiday party at my home and I had gotten some for the both of us to use since it was a party. The party ended with people arguing and over all was a bad experience because everyone was angry and the neighbors had threatened to call the cops. The next day his friend came up to visit and we dropped my ex (lets to call him D.F) off at work and we were going to wait for him to be off. His friend wanted to do cocaine and kept asking for it and I said oh yeah I have some but that I didn’t want to do any without D.F because he would be angry. His friend kept asking for it and asking to see it but I never showed it to him. That same day my housemate and my friend from out of town were going to hang out and we let D.Fs friend tag along since D.F was going to be at work until late. We are celebrating my out of town friends birthday and we start drinking a little and D.Fs friend gets very drunk very quickly and passes out. I drank very little because I was already having a stressful weekend because of the holiday party having left me with problems with neighbors and DF because his OTHER friend had gotten kicked out for being an overall asshole.Fast forward later that night I uber DF from work to my friends air bnb where we are hanging out but he is in a very bad mood already. His drunk friend starts going through my purse screaming that he knew it was in my purse because he “himself had put it in my purse” at this point D.F jumps up and starts screaming at me “why is he saying that why is he saying you have some” and I said I didn’t have any (I literally did not it was at my house with my roommate and we were all at D.Fs house like 1:30 in the morning ) and then he and his friend both  started going through my purse looking for it and when he didn’t find it he was still mad and they both started screaming at me that I was a lying bitch and kicked me out. He broke up with me that same night never again did he ever speak to me with kindness or even acknowledge that I was a an actual person or that we once in love. I have tried to contact him so many time I have tried to talk to him so many times to apologize because in my heart I know that I really do love him. Just a few of the things that he had said to me after that night were :Youre a cock sucking whore who probably fucked all my friends behind my back any chance you gotI wouldn’t be surprised if you sucked dick for drugs (to which I replied that I had never and he said “you’re right my bad you’re such a whore you probably sucked dick for free and still paid for drugs”)D.F said he never loved me and was so embarrassed and ashamed to have ever been with me because all I am is a dirty lying cheating whoreD.F said I chose drugs over himSaid that if I wanted to prove that I loved him (he said I clearly didn’t love him because if I did I would have never chosen drugs over him) that I needed to let him cum on my face and that he wanted me to have a threesome with him but to sit there and watch as he would fuck and another girl in front of me and eat her out and that maybe then he would believe that I love himD.F said he would never believe that I loved him or that I had never cheated on him because we had never had anal sex and he said that was what he really”desired” all along and that I knew it was his desire and never gave that to himHe would always ask to rip up my leggings before sex and it never happened because for whatever reason I never found my cheap leggings and I didn’t want him to rip up my 60-120 dollar leggings that I would wear often and alternate (the 120$ ones were a gift)D.F I was the absolute worst thing to ever happen to him and that I held him back from “saving even one dollar in 2019” this one hurt a lot because even though I made maybe half what he made I always insisted on paying and gave him gifts out of love and I honestly must have paid for at least 60% of the time just because I wanted to because he is the love of my life and it made me happy to buy him things and pay for him.He accused me of cheating with everyone even his friends and housematesHe said he wouldn’t be surprised if I had sex with the one guy at work who was the most awful disgusting person (this guy used to say that being around me made him want to rape me) because of how disgusting he believes I am tooSaid I never loved him not even a little because I had kept my drug use a secret from him (we had moments where he would scream at me and get really angry and punch walls when we first said we would stop and I would slip)I called him so many times crying begging him to please forgive me for hiding the drug use and he wouldn’t listen he would reply to everything I said with “I regret not cumming on your face every chance I got because you were off being a lying whore when I was respecting you by not cumming on your face every chance I got you didn’t deserve my loyalty”He said that his biggest regret was ever being with me and being loyal to me and not cheating because he missed out on fucking so many woman and that he was so angry at me for beating the reason why he didn’t get to fuck all those women and that would always be his number regret aside from not cumming on my face every chance he got or fucking me in the ass every chance he got (we tried to do anal but never did because it made me really uncomfortable and it hurt)He said he was so ashamed of me and he accused me of having sex with some guy weeks before I even dated D.F and I literally had no reason to lie about that because that was before I ever knew he had feelings for me. When I tried to get that other guy to tell him it wasn’t true D.F got so mad and said he really fucking hates me and that he was mad I had told that guy what D.F was saying because he didn’t want anyone to know he had dated me (everyone knew we were together I didn’t have to tell him but D.F claimed that this other guy knowing we were together proved that I had been cheating with him ALSO because “how else would he know we dated” everyone knew we were basically dating for months before we officially started dating and we didn’t hide it at all so everyone knew.Hearing the person I live so much say these things to me broke me. I felt that my heart had been shredded to pieces it hurts to wake up and to breathe. I was taken to the hospital 5 times and involuntarily hospitalized 3 times for wanting and trying to kill myself. I would try to talk to D.F when I couldn’t control my suicidal thoughts because then and even now the thought of living without him hurts so much and I wrote him so many goodbye suicide letter but with my failed attempts of suicide I got too scared to try to attempt again and just be locked up again in the hospital. A few times he replied and told em to not kill myself and as soon as I would try to talk to him or say I missed him and just needed to talk he would again start with the nasty cruel sexual remarks as listed above. Every time he says something cruel I can’t stop crying and the only thing that makes me calm myself a little is the thought that one day I will have a successful suicide and won’t have to hurt and hurt over losing him and making him hate me so much over stupid drugs.I just want to say if you got this far I never cheated on him and I never would have I love him so fucking much but he thinks I am capable of that because I didn’t tell him about 4-5 times I used drugs with my friends because I was worried that he would get so angry at me but I shouldn’t have thought that way because I knew and everyone knew he was also slipping and using without me and they would all tell me but I never said anything because I knew how hard it was to quit it myself.I haven’t used anything since then and it has been just about 8 months. It hurts so much I love D.F so much and I wish I had never told him of my suicidal thoughts because he thinks I’m crazy for “being so affected by someone’s words” but those words coming from the love of my life the only person I have ever loved has 100% destroyed and broken me.—— I miss D.F so much it hurts to even think about places that we would go to. He said he wants to forget me completely and it hurts so much because he always said he would love me forever and that I would always be in his heart. While he was breaking up with me he was crying and asking why I had to ruin us, why couldn’t I have just been honest because he never fell in love with anyone but he fell in love with me and that I was his dream girl but that I had ruined it all :’(He replied a few weeks ago to tell me to stop trying to contact him because of how much he hates me. I replied that I am sorry and I feel so much pain and feel like I need to apologize again and again and that I know no matter how much I apologize it will never be enough. He replied to that by saying he doesn’t have the time or care enough to hear anything i have to say because he is on his way to fuck his “current white girlfriend who thinks his dick is amazing and can’t get enough of it” and he also says that he regularly fucks a “40 year old milf pussy who is so much better than me and who does all the things I never did” I don’t know if the 40 year old is the new girlfriend but he also said right after that he and his friend, let’s call him billy “ran a train on a girl the other day” and that he loves how sexy these girls are unlike me whose “face always looked like a retard during sex”.As if I wasn’t hurt enough now all I can think of is him with this girl(s) and it kills me. It hurts so fucking bad I have never been treated anywhere remotely as bad as this but I love him so much it HURTS so bad :’(A week after that I messaged him again that I was thinking of him and saw some shoes I knew he would like and I wanted him to have them but I forgot his shoe size to which he simply replied “14”. I mailed him two pairs of shoes, Air Force one and Jordans. I tracked the package to make sure it got there and a few days after it did I tried to ask if it had been received and got no reply to the question other than the usual “fuck off I hate you nasty cheating cocksucking whore”There is so much more but I can’t stop crying thinking g about it all to write right now but I will edit and add more as I can.",,

But since death didn't seem like a solution, I decided to try and do it the difficult way. Take care of myself and ensure others do not end up like me. Well, I have terribly failed to do either of them. The only thing I have ended up becoming is more toxic. And these days I cannot interact with people at all.

I mean, it would be hard for them as they too ar battling similar stuff - but what can I do?The most scary thing is that previously I have been suicidal when I had been mentally unstable and not able to functions properly. This time around it's not like that at all. I'm fully functioning, can think and all. Even put up a smiling face to ensure people I'm okay, but deep inside I know there's a war going on whether I should kill myself or not. I can't say this to anyone close to me as they are gonna get trigerred. Idk what to say to my therapist as well.

I can change thoughts after deliberation but I cannot give up on my principles no matter how differently aligned they maybe to the functioning of this world.

I feel like I want my life to end. I'm so full of despair right now. It isn't a singular thing I'm depressed about. It's lot of things. I just feel unaccomplished and as though I squandered all my opportunities. Probably the one I'm most devastated about is my teeth. Due to poor parenting early on, I wasn't taught the routine of brushing my teeth which led me to never really take it up for  most of childhood. I'd brush occasionally but definitely didn't meet the 2x per day recommendation consistently for quite some time, I'm talking teens people. As a result, I have pretty bad teeth - not the worst - but for someone my age they're in pretty bad shape. About 6 missing teeth, 3 top premolars, 1 top molar and 2 bottom molars. I'm devastated. I'm utterly crushed. I haven't seen a dentist in at least a decade. I know I need at least 6 dental implants, some fillings and goodness knows what else. I don't know if I could even afford this. I'm just horrifically ruined by this. I'll never be normal or have normal teeth. I envy other people's teeth so much. I would do almost anything to turn back time. I'm just so... so miserable. I wish I could correct it all. I wish I could have perfect teeth. But I won't. It'll be a just a life time of management and failed treatment. I'm a little suicidal, I'll be honest. Seems overdramatic but it ruins me, having people see my teeth, judge my teeth and the fact that I can't eat properly. I'm just crushed. Totally crushed. I wish I could start over. It'll be years and thousands of pounds of reconstruction.Secondly, my education. To be fair, I didn't really fail and I have enough to get me where I need to go but I still feel as though I didn't achieve my full ability. I just didn't quite push myself and make it. I didn't just out my head down for a few years. I wish I could turn back time. I wish I could change it all. I would do it all different. But I don't have that luxury, none of us do. I'm so horribly miserable. I've just messed up everything. Ruined every given opportunity. I just such a waste. I was born in a good country without war, famine, pestilence... I was given everything I needed to lead a healthy life, for free practically with the NHS and government schemes. I had it all and yet I still... I STILL messed it up. People out there who'd fight and do anything for what I have. And yet I blew it. I blew it. There's no other way to put it. I don't deserve this life. I don't.",,

But “soon or later” something could happen. I don’t understand anybody or feel like I belong. I don’t have anyone to talk about myself. I hate the word “feelings”. Even if I did have someone, it would probably take me a while to open up. I hate my “feelings”. Instead of opening up, I rather keep everything in because I don’t want to bother anyone with how I “feel”. Even if they say there not being bothered, they probably don’t care. Pretty much everyone I know. I feel like no one actually cares to know how I feel so I don’t even bother but like I always say “I’m okay.” Now it’s “chilling” I’m not okay though. I don’t know why I hate myself so fucking much. Why would anyone even care about me? There’s no fucking answer/reason to that question. Honestly I’m reaching that fucking point where I just don’t care. I don’t care what happens to me. I do care what will happen after, I don’t want to be a burden to my family. Making them pay for my funeral, or breaking my mother’s heart. But I’m getting to that fucking point. I don’t know what I want anymore. I WANT someone I can talk to about EVERYTHING and  someone that actually care and conforts me. Not someone that is there for me but NOT really there for me. But then again why would anyone wanna be there for me when I’m a fucking ASSHOLE. I’m honestly sorry to anyone and everyone I’ve hurt in any way possible. I swear I try not to be a dick most of the time. I am truly sorry. I want someone to be there for me but the way I act doesn’t show it... at the same time i don’t FUCKING like these “feelings”. I hate them. I “feel” out of place all the fucking time. Like I shouldn’t even be here because I’m just so fucking different. I’m not like others, I think. I’m way to honest and sometimes that fucks me over. Because I REALLY JUST DO WANT THE BEST FOR OTHERS. But I don’t show it in the right way. if i did, maybe then people would actually like me. Nobody really knows me... i don’t either with sounds cheesy asf but when you “feel” this way it’s the only way to explain it. I’m insecure of my weight, and how I act. The way I act ISNT the way I wish I would act. Look at Ali, he’s naturally funny. Nathan is nice, and respectful. Everyone wants to come up to Markus for anything. I wish I had these traits then maybe i would actually have more friends, closer friends. Instead I’m stuck in my room typing my “feels” out because I don’t know who to text, or tell. I don’t want to bother anyone nor do I want to tell someone who will only care when I ask for there help. Like if I wasn’t actually bother you then you would go out on a limb and ask me how I feel. I hate myself. I’m sorry to everyone. If I even said something that was wrong in the slightest way, I’m sorry. —————————————— I don’t know how I feel, it all could be fake. Do I write about my self in note because I want attention? Why don’t I have any friends. I have no friends. None. Okay maybe I do have some friends but why don’t I talk to them about me wanting to kill myself. I don’t want to talk to me mom or family. Why would I tell them about my suicidal thoughts? So they can hurt and be worried about me? I can’t tell anyone how I feel. I don’t have any one who is really there or checks up on me. Emma sure I could talk to her but no. I don’t know why.

I like to put out there that there are many reasons I still have suicidal ideation. I used to want to be nice to everyone and thought life was good. But after some backstabs, not knowing how to deal with vain and difficult people,friendships growing more distant, never knew how to stand up to bullies or people who take advantage of you, developing trust issues, I grow more desensitized, less compassionate, more stressed/careful about people,feel sadistic when esp bad people suffer, and more cynical. I'm also shy introvert but can talk to some people depending. I don't have any close friends(which I perceive could still make time to talk to you even if they have a long day of work) and partner. I feel I probably turn more of a blind eye to animals who need help in front of me because I am too concerned about myself or don't care much. Also it seems in this world, you can't be yourself, especially at work, such as being strictly professional and not suffer wrath of mean bosses if possible. Moreover, it seems I have to be in part of ""white lies"", which I felt touched my moral nerve, to get into nursing school and do well on interviews and ""wear a mask"" if go to work as a nurse. FYI I am not nurse but currently am in college.(and I may end up not like nursing after I tried nursing school and jobs i guess) Although I still want a good house, stable income, be independent from parents, and have enough money to do side projects, I feel I can't live with values. Such as working at a workplace that is true to itself and filled with compassionate and fair people. I used to look up to law enforcement, medical field, school systems, law, and government,etc. However, when I look around those places and other work, there always seems to be corruption and suffering.(ie. bully victims being punished rather than bullies for fighting back, police just frame innocent people, arrogant doctors harass and act condescending towards nurses, us people somehow allowed some president to allow covid situation to worsen and many people suffer the consequences with the virus). Also, I know I am not creatively minded and great problem solving person to be appealed to demanding different jobs out there nowadays. I often felt uncorfortable to be part of jobs or companies(i guess that's like pretty much everywhere) that has corruption within that I cannot help deal with and just help instead to continue their existence. I feel if I continue living I feel I am one of many people out that contribute to the worsening of the environment like driving cars(make ozone layer worse). And also I feel some guilt that I survive and ignore people who seem to suffer non-stop depression,suicidal, and hopelessness because I don't exactly know how to help them effectively and feel I may drain my own energy. I also wonder if people who committed suicide were always destined to never have their mortal lives saved. I did see some therapists but I can't still resolve my being too pure thoughts. If I were a theist, I would not want to be with a God that restricts freedom unreasonably, be contractidictory between what's out there and what's in ""holy document(s)"", allows evil and corruption to spread on earth,(and people's lives continued to be obliterated), and somehow created someone like me to suffer due to having a curious mind and being knowledgeable and uncertain. I often feel empty inside, and that I don't deserve to be happy. I still don't know my life purpose and unsure if I could be capable to help make big changes in the world. There's seems to always be injustice in this world and not much good people left to make significant changes to overcome such injustice. Does anyone feel like they are too pure for this world and rather kill themselves and not be corrupted? What ways, if any, do you deal with these being too pure feelings and still live? Is there no hope for pure hearted people to live in this world even anymore? Also any advice for my own case? Even links and readings are alright.",,

I’ve always struggled with depression and suicide. I seemed to be on a really long really happy streak. Things were great. I’d just gotten a new job about 2 months before the accident. I loved this job. Right up my ally. Easy enough and a small group of coworkers I can count on and trust. One Friday 4:30 came around and I was so excited for the weekend ahead and just to be home and chillin for a few day. At 4:33 I would be t-boned in the intersection right next to my job. Unfortunately I sustained a small amount of injuries and the car was totaled. Being a month has passed since the accident and I am physically fine. I mean. I am more sore than usually and my neck kinda bothers me but these are small things I work through in order to bring home money. I can’t go to the doctor really because 3k deductible on my insurance. But my depression has gotten so bad. Since the wreck I feel bummy having to ride to work with people and just never having a ride anywhere. Plus things with my wife are horrible. We love each other but we can’t get along it makes things much worse. I own a handgun. I play with it often. But have decided to sell it because it almost haunts me. I know it will not fix the issue. I feel like it will keep me from doing anything I can’t take back. I would never use a knife or a rope or pills because I do not want to suffer. I feel as though I am suffering every single day. I wake up and my stomach hurts really bad and I dread going to work. I dread everything. If something makes me happy it is only momentary before the thought of worthlessness and suicide creep back in and begin to drown me. I have taken medication to balance my emotions and sustain a calm headspace in the past but I do not like it. The side effects aren’t worth the good the medication does. Even then why would I take medication in this scenario. Am I the only human who would like to be happy without having to dissolve chemicals in my stomach. I mean what does that say about a person who has to take a pill every morning just to avoid killing themselves. I feel weak because I can’t ever pull the trigger. I can’t just say enough is enough and end it all even though it seems like that would fix everything. I am so fucking lost in this forest of despair and hopelessness. People say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. (23 M) I’ve been suicidal since I was 13. Can someone please explain to me how many years “temporary” is supposed to cover?

My story that I have to tell is long but I will keep it short. It already startet at the age of 11 when my Father died because of an car accident. My classmates started to bully me until the end of school (end of the 10th grade). Thought out the following years after the accident I had my first suicide attempt at the age of 16, 2 years later another one. Now I am 23 and everything I witnessed until today got stuck in my head. I started running from my problems and hide myself behind a smiling face while I am dead inside. Constantly thinking about to leave this shit show so called life. I just recently lost my GF too because I couldn't tell her what's really going through my head, I am about to loose another job (2nd apprenticeship) as well because I can't tell anyone how I really feel without getting smiled at while just trying to hide myself again. I've falling into a deep depression because of the loss and the mental abuse over the years. I can't sleep at night anymore Everything just feels wrong.I am sorry if I wrote anything confusing I am native German and I am currently not really able to find the right words for how I feel at the moment Thank you for any help in advice",,

I feel like I already bother them enough. I don't wanna be that one friend always fucking whining and complaining. I think that's why all my previous friends got sick of me and now they've probably forgotten about me. Probably for the better. I feel so ashamed by the fact that I exist. I am everything wrong with humanity. My life lacks any sort of meaning.  And I don't even wanna die. But right now it seems like the only way out. I'm stupid and messed up my relationship with the person I love the most of on Earth. I've only managed to keep one friend but who knows for how long that'll last. Soon he'll get sick of me too. I think the only way to remain friends is to not feel too much, to not be very attached to the friendship. And how do I do that when we're becoming closer friends every time we talk? I'm a failure, I feel like I'm bad at everything I do. I've playing the piano for years but I still can't play a single full song. I've been learning Russian for 3 years but am yet to advance beyond a very basic level. I have more than 360 hours in CS:GO but I'm so awful at the game other players often insult me and my team often loses games because of me. All of these are things I love doing and I've been putting a lot of effort.  But lately I've just been giving up. Why study Russian, why ever play the piano again? I'm terrible, I keep playing the same thing every day, over and over. Do I even deserve to live? I'm an awful, bad person. I lie and I hurt people and I'll never change despite desperately wanting too. Every time I look myself in the mirror, I feel disgust. I despise myself. i want to change so bad but I keep failing over and over again. I just wanna fucking die. It's the only way out.

I live in Italy and I have a problem: since I was 13 I keep thinking that my existence is a waist of space and resources. I have never attempted or tried to attempt any kind of suicidal gesture, but this nagging thought has never left my brain for more than one day. I am a waist of space and resources. I am currently studying at university to become an engineer, I am currently volunteering in my parish to help adolescent socialize, I am currently singing in two different choirs as a tenor. I have things to do, I have friends to meet, objectives to look forward to, but I can't help this feeling of helplessness that is making hard to maintain the social net that I threw myself into hoping that will give me something to live for. My family is actually very supportive and I was never in need of something that they were not willing to provide, from education, to emotional support, to financial support. Somehow this makes it even harder. I have never told any of my relatives about this feeling I have because I didn't (and I still don't) want to upset them or ask them to spend more economic, mental and emotional resources on me. I've told three people about this situation: the first one, who was my girlfriend at the time, laughed at me like I was telling the best joke you can imagine; the second one listened but I sense she got the idea that this thing is in the past and everything is fine now; the last one listened and insisted that I looked for help. I am in a situation in which it is difficult even to ask for any help. I don't want to waste anyone's time or effort in fixing me. You would be better off with pretty much everybody else. So I'm living in this state in which I clearly need help, but I don't want to get it (especially I can't afford to spend any money on something like this). I am painfully aware that my problem is a first world problem that I would never even have the luxury to have if I was born in another country or even in another family, and I do recognise the privilege I have in the life experiences I am living right now; but please do understand that this pain is real and it makes difficult even to get through the day. Another thing that I am painfully aware of is that this text is too long and I don't believe many have read the hole thing. To all of you who have come this far goes my warmest thank you for listening to this nonsensical rant about my short period of time on planet earth. Please forgive me if I made any grammatical or syntactic mistake, but English is not my first language. Have a nice day you all beautiful people.<3",,

Im lost- in a bubble that I cant bring myself to break out of.for what feels like all of my 20 years of life, ive never felt happy. sure, ive laughed and cried like anyone else, but the moment im alone i wipe that mask off and immediately feel sad.I hate literally everything about myself. I feel like a walking disaster. A lot of times, recently more than ever, I feel like I don’t belong on this earth- like it doesn’t have a place for me anymore, and that ill soon be homeless or in jail. At one point I considered committing a crime just to go to jail on purpose, so maybe then id have a roof over my head and (albeit shitty) food in front of me… and most other times I think about ending my life altogether, so that I can end this painful cycle.at first, when i began having these darker thoughts at 13 and 14, i thought, perhaps, I hadn’t lived enough of my life yet to determine whether I want to live or not- so I gave myself more time to find what im good at or what I love. but even now, that mindset hasn’t changed. Im miserable. I feel like im a terrible person, whose role on this earth is to show others how NOT to be. After all, im not one to believe everyone deserves to be happy.In middle school, I was placed in a “gifted and talented” program that continued until I graduated. Usually, the GT kids were on trek to do great things- I know people from that class that have gone on to start awesome jobs or be accepted on full ride scholarships to big universities. And yet, despite being told my entire life how smart I am by being lumped with those students, Ive never had a passion or a talent that made me feel like I belonged there. I have a terrible inferiority complex with everyone I meet- Im not super funny, attractive, athletic, charismatic, smart… I feel painfully subpar in literally everything I do. My grades were always BARELY passing, and I was a lazy uninspired student. I have no real, useful skills. Nada. I can’t cook, do mental math, or play sports, and im not particularly adept in ANY field… instead I burn my life away on video games, but even on those im not anything special whatsoever. I’ve had this plot in my head that ive been trying to convert to paper for YEARS to write a novel, but I can never bring myself to do it. I quit easily and I feel like I can never finish what I started. I have no motivation or work ethic to improve myself, and I break my own promises constantly- I tell myself ill try to be better, put in X amount of hours a day toward something that could make me happier, but it never happens. In fact, its NEVER happened. And at the spiraling rate I find myself in now, it never will. I feel like ill ALWAYS be terrible at everything.And the worst part about all of this? All throughout my journey to find my purpose, the one thing that will make me the happiest, I’ve been told how smart and gifted I am and how my family is so proud of me. How much of an inspiration I am toward my little siblings. But in truth, I’m terrified of the possibility that they could grow up to be like me. I’m nothing special. “Oh wow! You’re struggling? Well youre so smart so youll figure it out!” No. I don’t think I ever will. And I don’t think anyone will ever understand. Im not the person everyone found me to be.A few years ago, I told myself (half-seriously) I would commit suicide if I’m still single by the time I turned 25 years old… and now, more than ever, I feel like choosing that course of action. My attempts at romance are pathetically terrible- I cope by watching romantic anime/tv shows and reading romantic books which serve as a convenient distraction. I am socially awkward by every definition- I have a sentence-immobilizing stutter and I can never fit into any conversation casually. My social skills are… well, if I called it trash it would imply that it somewhat exists, which it really doesnt. I can’t talk to anyone im not close to, much less people I find attractive- I only operate within a tight group of friends. But even then I always open my mouth when I shouldn’t or my terribly shitty personality ruins something for me and they decide that its just not worth it to be my friend anymore.Over the past 8 years ive spent on the internet, ive lost dozens of people who once called me close- all because I made one too many painfully wrong decisions or said something that had no business being said. A close group of friends have all but removed/blocked me from every aspect of their lives because I wouldn’t stop complaining about their decisions, and I was continuously argumentative and aggressive for no reason. They booted me because I was being an asshole- and the worst part is, it’s the same cycle over and over again and yet, despite me promising to be a better person every single time, it almost never works out. I have nobody to blame but myself. I hate it. It feels like I can never catch a break. Nobody else is compatible with me and I dread every single day the one conversation that will cause my last group of close friends, the only ones I have left, to completely abandon me. It’s happened so many times… and if it happens again, I don’t think I’ll have anything left to stop me from offing myself for real. I hate it that im such a brash, headstrong asshole.

That’s it. But now more than ever that seems like an impossible task. I want to find the love that I’ve read about, and that my engaged friends and ex-friends have found. I want to love myself and see myself in the light that my family sees me in. I want to be an example for the people who look up to me.Im sorry if this was messy. This was written in the moment.

Some days I feel as though I am full of self hatred and misery. These days where I want to lock myself in my bedroom and cry. It is very strange to feel worthless all of the time.

I honestly don't like talking about my problems, because I feel like no one cares, even if they say they do. Anyways.. So.. My early childhood was amazing. I always got everything I wanted. I never was bullied in school or anything, and I had a good relationship to my parents, especially to my dad. Though I always was an introvert, so it was hard for me to find friends.. But besides that everything was good. Everything changed on February the 3rd, 2015. It was a Tuesday. I woke up and got ready to go to school. My dad was feeling really sick, I didn't think much about it, because it happened sometimes.  I went to school, and when I came back he still felt really sick. He was sleeping all day. At about 5 PM he got up and talked to me and my mom, he said that he started feeling a bit better, but he wanted to sleep some more. And so he did. That was the last time I saw him alive. At about 7 PM my mom found him in their bed, not breathing. We called an ambulance and after hours of trying to reanimate him, they declared him dead at 12 AM. I will never forget how he was laying there while they were trying to reanimate him. Every since that they everything in my life went down hill. I started skipping school, my grades went down hill for a while, I started cutting myself, and I started having suicidal thoughts. It always felt like it was my fault that he died, even though I know it wasn't my fault. To this day, I still cannot believe that he's gone. He was basically my best friend. My head just keeps telling me that it was my fault. I was so close to just killing myself so many times now, because of the smallest things. Ever since that they I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to... anything, really. I wanted to cut open my wrists, hang myself, jump off a bridge.. etc. I also started isolating myself more and more over the past years.Everyone I talked about my problems with, always told me to seek professional help. I did that a while ago, ever since that I went through two therapists so far, of which only one could kinda help me. And the only thing that helped me was the anti depressants he gave me, the talking was rather annoying and always made me feel uncomfortable. The anti depressants really helped me. I started having less and less suicidal thoughts, I completely stopped cutting myself, and I was just feeling happier than ever. But since he isn't my therapist anymore I now don't get any anti depressants, and everything went to shit again. I just don't get why this shit can't stop already. I have enough of these thoughts. I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the point where I'd just finally end it all. Even though I promised my mom that I would never. I don't feel like i have much of a life later anyway. So.. what's even the point in continuing...I'll just stop now, because this text is already long enough. I'm already regretting that I wrote this, sorry to everyone who read through this. Anyways... If you did read through all this.. Thanks, I guess.",,

I feel like I’ve lived 10 different lives and none of them are worth it. I’ve had to fight my whole life just to end up replacing one problem or person with another that’s even worse for me.I can’t keep fighting and being around for everyone. They wouldn’t miss me. They’d be glad I’m gone.All my life I’ve dealt with bullshit. I’m 21 now, but in 2008 we lost our home, car, and pretty much everything else to the banks thanks to the recession. My dad only graduated from high school and lost his job managing sales reps a phone book company and became a used car salesman.The year after that my mom was diagnosed as schizophrenic and bipolar. She had a few years of teaching elementary school under her belt, but after she had five kids she never worked much after that. Any substitute teaching gig would cause her to have a psychotic break. I was 9 at the time and I have two brothers and two sisters who have had to cope with living with a mom who would say and do horrible things to them and not know if it was her or her illness.This threw us into poverty and from the time I was 10 to the time I graduated high school basically I was always considered “different”. I went to a high school where it was a very small, high middle-class Christian community, where judgement was a hobby of many students. I got bullied so fucking much then people wonder why I seem unapproachable. People won’t even come up to me because of how intimidating I come off so I always have to be the one to introduce myself or greet somebody first.Coming home to a schizophrenic mother who doesn’t do anything except for lay in bed and neglect her children and household isn’t the most encouraging. Living with my parents is a fucking dump. They don’t clean up after themselves. Currently my older three siblings moved out but my little brother and I find it unbearable here. My dad works all day and comes home and doesn’t do shit either. I’ve heard my mom mention on numerous occasions she wishes us younger two hadn’t been born but glad we were around for chores. She’s told me she wished I had succeeding in liking myself. That I’m a depressed piece of shit.I’ve had people rallying by my side and believing in me for years but I just can’t do it anymore.I’ve tried to cope in all of the worst ways. I attempted suicide when I was 15 and I slit my wrist open and I was so close to hitting the main vein that the scar sits on top of it but I hadn’t quite cut deep enough unfortunately. Did land me five days in a mental health facility. Gave me antidepressants and I went home.Thankfully my parents are firm believers in mental health after having to handle my mom’s diagnosis. For anyone who doesn’t know, it can be very difficult to treat. My mom and my family suffered a lot from her diagnosis, it took a solid ten years of trying different medications and eventually having to move her into a women’s group home for a year for us to find meds that work for her. She’s still a bitch though.Thing is, they knew I needed help and acknowledged that. They took me to counseling one time after my attempt because we thankfully had insurance at the time. Any other scheduled appointment after that they didn’t take me because they were “too tired” or “didn’t have gas”, even though me and my four siblings have been helping pay the bills and groceries and paying gas money since we were all old enough to have jobs. They just didn’t care or think it was bad enough.To cope with my reality, I started cutting more often. I haven’t cut since last June, and for that I’m really proud of myself. I started making myself throw up anytime I’d get anxious, purging myself of all my pain. I stopped doing that eventually too. I began smoking weed and experimenting with any drug that was available to me. Before I knew it I was snorting xanax off the desk in fifth period and I tried heroin and got stuck on it for about a month. Thankfully I did feel withdrawals and thought I was going to die from how much pain I’m in, so I’m almost three years clean from that as of August 8th. I’m really impulsive and emotional and I’m scared I might be bipolar too.Finally when I turned 18 I moved into my best friends house and graduated high school a semester early and worked my ass off to buy a car before I went to college. I got through a lot of bad times. I was still feeling pretty depressed though. Saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with clinical depression, ADHD, OCD, and PTSD and major substance abuse issues. By the time I was ready for my next appointment our insurance expired. That was two years ago and since then I’ve accomplished a lot, two years of college and even made the deans list one semester!Thing is, none of those accomplishments are enough to make me hopeful that there will be an end to this pain. The way I see it, life is just replacing old problems with new ones and I don’t want that for myself. The nuances of life are more hurtful to me than they are helpful and I just can’t take it anymore. I have nobody. I feel so alone. It doesn’t feel worth it to me. I don’t even know what I’m living for anymore.",,

I promised myself I wouldn’t make it to 13. Here I still am 4 years later. I feel as if I am doing myself a great disservice by putting myself through all this when the answer is right there. Every day that I stay I get attached to people who give me some momentary happiness. But I’ve noticed these people leave your life swiftly. Nothing’s permanent, but for someone like me with anxiety and apparently some moderate OCD, I’d prefer things to be permanent and sure. Here’s where my fear of doing is comes in. I want to do it in a way that will 100% make sure I die. But where I live we don’t have access to things like guns which I think would be the most accurate way. I don’t like the idea of bleeding out, I feel like it’d be painful. I don’t want my last moments to be painful. I’ve access to plenty of prescription drugs which I could use but from what I’ve heard it’s not 100% sure fire way to die. On top of this I’ve heard it’s slow and painful. Don’t try and say this is a sign that I don’t want to do it pls. I know I do, I’m just scared of pain and failure. Recently I’ve noticed that my suicidal thought  and tendencies are becoming less impulsive and more of an all the time thing, they’re starting to get more and more inescapable. I’ve told my mother all that I feel comfortable telling her but she ignores it. All the clear signs, everything. I’ve social anxiety but she forces me into socialising with people. I have to make a bunch of sacrifices to appease her but the minute I ask her to compromise for the sake of my mental health she calls me selfish and rude. I can’t. My sister is verbally abusive and has s been for the past 4 years and my mother does nothing despite me telling her time upon time. I’ve written suicide not after suicide note but she simply discards them. I used to feel she was a reason to stay, but I’m rapidly beginning to realise I have only myself in this world. I just really feel like I’m worth nothing tbh. All I had was my intelligence but I feel like that’s dissipating too. There really is nothing here for me. Sometimes I do like looking at what I could do with my future but idk it all seems so distant and unobtainable for me. Idk. Right now the most probable way of me doing it is going to be OD on the aforementioned prescription drugs. I think I’m ready tbh. I get back some important exam results in 3 weeks and a couple days. I’m feeling that if those don’t go well I’ll be done here. I have some amazing friends, don’t get me wrong, but at the end of the day they’re just temporary like everyone and everything else in this world. I have already them a final letter.

I still hate everything about myself, I still am depressed about my family, I still self harm, I still want to die, and I still cant motivate myself to do basic tasks unless my parents literally force me. Meanwhile, I've lost almost all my friends, and the one friend I do have is basically becoming what I always wanted to be. She has a good job, she has a great boyfriend who shes in a committed relationship with, shes getting more confident everyday, and even though she obviously still has problems, she just is everything I wanted to be when I turned 16. Now, of course, I'm not jealous or bitter or anything, I'm so glad for her, its just I already always feel like I'm in her shadow. The most intense crush of my life only pretended to b interested in me to get to her, my most recent ex literally stopped responding to me and started being freaky with her.I just feel like the only thing that is actually productive with me right now, is my head. I'm always thinking of ideas I never fucking act on. I've planned my suicide, but I havent done it because I want to kill myself at school. I genuinely just don't want to exsist anymore. My dad said he would get me therapy after I tried to kill myself, but that was like 5 months ago. Oh, and guess who's getting help and therapy? My best friend. The worst thing is when my friends parents try to get them help and they complain about it. I would love to stop wanting to fucking die, and wanting to fucking starve myself, and fucking going in a horrible binge/purge cycle. I'd love to be able to take care of myself again like a normal god damb human being.I just feel like a failure to everyone. My dad always says people who add nothing to society shouldn't be alive. I think he hates me too. Everytime he invites me to go out somewhere without my family I'm scared hes going to shoot me or burn me on a stake. Its stupid because I want to fucking die, but I dont want my last day to be me being scared of my dad. And I'm not scared of my family for any particular reason I'm just paranoid.I just want to be able to be human again, but it seems like no one else even cares, so why should I? I'm not even religious so killing myself means nothing to me. It just means I'll be dead, nothing will happen. Yea sure my friends will be sad for like a day or two but eventually theyll forget about me, and then theyll die too. I only have like two friends anyways and they both have way more friends than me that they'd rather hang out with anyways.I just want to die.",,

I wanna jump off a building so badly but my body just refuses to. I have a guilt tripping father and a verbally abusive friend. I’m pansexual and I keep getting called “biphobic” when I only wanna be accepted for who I am and I’d never ever be biphobic in my life! I tried so hard to fit in but at least 1 person said “so your biphobic?” And it’s making me think “should I change my sexuality? Am I really biphobic?” And I hit my head against the wall and get none stop headaches because of it. I always get caught scratching myself on purpose and all my parents do is scream in my face, I know they wanna help me but that isn’t helping me at all. And then they’re saying I’m fake crying and I’m only looking for reactions or it’s because of that phone. I’ve been thinking I want to run away or smash the window open and jump because life is just hellish and terrible and I just wanna kill myself. My mom refuses to take me to any therapist or counseling to sort this out, I already went one time because my mom thought I had autism but I didn’t and only had anxiety. But since my mental health has gotten worse I’ve been asking her if I could go to the doctors again to check and all she says is “no, you heard what the other doctor said, it’s just anxiety.” I’ve been having breakdowns in my bed and crying myself to sleep thinking I’ll never be accepted into this world. I’m scared and worried of almost everything, even death but I’m wanting to commit suicide. It’s so annoying and painful physically and emotionally. I’m being told I don’t deserve to be in the LGBTQ+ community because I’m pansexual, and it honestly just makes me cry. I wish I could just take some sort of drug that’ll take the worry away. My verbally abusive friend used to pretend to be their cousin and send me pictures of knives telling me to kill myself or they’re going to kill themselves. Once they pretended to kill themselves and when they told me it was a prank they said “oh shut up crybaby I don’t care if you kill yourself, at least your sensitive ass will be off this world” then a day later they act like they never said that at all, and if they own up to it they’ll just say “oh that was a late April fools prank” or “oh that was my cousin/sibling” and it just pisses me off. I got eczema but then when I took the Medicine that was supposed to help treat it got worse. Now it’s probably psoriasis. I’m stressed out all the time over the smallest of things and I’m getting judged for roleplaying as a JoJo character and told I’m an “edgelord” or im cringe, and now the people are stalking my friends online because of that. I hate it when people fake their depression or any mental illness or attention seek too, because it’s just offensive... I just can’t take it anymore, I can’t take life. I want help, I want friends, I just want help.",,

That I ate a proper meal, that I am happy because of him. This is the reason I hate myself. I almost never think like this and always try to see reason on both sides, but this time... I can't.",,

I’m 23 years old, a military wife, I have 2 kids. An almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. I am literally thousands of miles away from my family and my best friend. I’ve lived in Virginia for 3 years and I’ve made no friends. I’m suicidal. Can’t go a day without wanting to die. The one time I called a suicide hotline the operator told me “is this an emergency? I have someone on the other line and I can’t talk to you unless it’s an emergency” and I just hung up. My body and soul feel empty. My mom was never very good at being a mom, but it was okay because I had my aunt and my mother in law. But my mother in law died of brain cancer in January 2019, having only been diagnosed 5 months prior. And my aunts son (my cousin) raped and molested me as a kid and when I told her she just.... kinda pretended that it didn’t happen. My husband and I used to be really close but he works all the time and when he comes home he drink a whole bottle of whatever good alcohol was on sale and goes to sleep. His mom just died last year and I know he’s sad too. He’s almost never home, he barely gets to see his kids grow up. I really feel for him. But he lives in his own world where nothing really matters except getting to the next day. And I can’t really blame him because I relate. But we don’t have sex anymore. We barely talk to each other. I’ve mentioned I’m suicidal and he says things like “it’ll be okay” without looking up from his phone across the room. I’ve tried begging for his attention in the past but it really gets me nowhere so I don’t try much anymore. All I want is to feel any kind of lust for life. I’ve always struggled with depression but I would have happy days on occasion. I don’t remember the last time I had a happy day. I feel awful for my kids, I promised I would be a present mother for my kids, I promised I’d do the opposite of what my mom did but all I want to do is lay in bed and cry. I’ve stopped eating. I gained 50 pounds since having kids and I’ve always had body dysmorphia and even when I was 120 lbs (I’m 5’7) I thought I was a giant fatass. Now that I’m 170 (or more? I don’t step on the scale anymore lmao) I’ve decided to just stop eating because maybeeee it’ll help me hate my life less? If I’m not so fucking fat? I know that’s not how it works but it’s hard to get rid of an eating disorder mindset. I don’t have these standards for anyone else, just me. I don’t think about cheating on my husband or anything... I don’t want to destroy his life or my kids lives. I just want mine to end. Honestly the only reason we haven’t divorced is because I don’t have the money to move me and my two kids across the country. I wish I could put into words to someone that I need help but I’m just convinced no one wants to hear it. We have guns in the house. I hold mine against my head sometimes but I’ve never pulled the trigger (obviously). It calms me weirdly enough.",,

I thought I lost every piece of evidence, every photo of my family, every project and poem I never finished. I remember feeling like half of me was breaking off from the whole and I started punching walls and crying uncontrollably. I called the suicide hotline 3 times and each time it disconnected. Tried calling my sister afterward because I was losing feeling. Her signal was off, so I couldn't even talk to her until I remembered I could use an app so I called her on there.I just remember crying and screaming and flashbacks to my great grandmother and just wanting to be with her. Just wanting to go home and be with her (she's been dead for over about 10 years). Flashbacks to my exes, both romantic and platonic. I saw it all and just felt another side come out.I started taking pills. I just wanted to sleep to get away. So I wouldn't have to deal with any of it anymore. So I kept taking pills and my sister kept telling me to stop. I was told to take as many as I needed to calm down, but my new doctor said to not do that. So my sister kept telling me to stop. I don't remember much after that. I remember at some point I asked if she could let me play a mobile game with my niece because she isn't allowed to have her phone right now. I don't know how long we played, but then I woke up around 9pm, stayed up until past 5am, and then went back to sleep for a few hours. My knuckles hurt but aren't bleeding this time. I'm tired, and I keep going in and out of a dissociative state. Right now I've taken 2 pills and nothing is happening, but I just spoke to my sister and don't want to take more. I'm afraid to feed that side of me.The majority of me wants to die. Then I think of my sister, nephew, and niece ad I don't want to anymore. I don't want to hurt them and abandon them like I was by so many people. They are the family I wish I had growing up and that part of me that wants to die happy, wants to stay alive to enjoy my time with them. So I don't think I'm mad at myself for coming into their lives because I don't know if I want to live anymore... I know I don't want to live anymore and I'm mad at myself because now a part of me does. I'm mad at myself for thinking something good will happen for once. For holding onto them as a lifeline when nothing has ever worked before. I hate myself for reaching out to them, when I could've just let the other side take over and end it all.This internal conflict is so strong and overbearing. There is so much going on and I don't want to hurt them. I've never had people that loved me unconditionally. That were always there when I really needed them. That were honest and didn't just say what they thought I wanted to hear. That weren't afraid to just sit and listen without taking on my pain as their own and then ghosting me because they couldn't deal with it. I feel stuck, but I have a virtual intake appointment with the therapy department for my hospital tomorrow. I'm on the waiting list for psychiatry again. When I told my new PCP earlier this year that I didn't want to be in it anymore ( I had a breakdown and left old therapist and psychiatrist after they triggered something in me), he still put me on the list. Apparently he decided against what I said and now I might be able to get into psychiatry soon as well. I don't know what they could possibly do or tell me that I haven't heard before, but this is my last shot. I've never had this much support before and I'm going to see what becomes of it. If all these people are willing to fight alongside me in this, I want to at least give it a shot with them before I let go completely.I want to die happy, and happy to me is anything better than my current state of mind.
